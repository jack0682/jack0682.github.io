## üß† **Paper I: Foundations of Cognitive Collaboration**

### **"Towards Cognitive Collaborative Robots: Semantic-Level Integration and Explainable Control for Human-Centric Cooperation"**

**Publication Details:**
- **arXiv ID**: [2505.03815](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03815)
- **Submission Date**: May 15, 2025
- **Primary Author**: Oh Jaehong
- **Status**: Under Review - ICRA 2026

- üé• **Demo Videos**: Real-time collaborative assembly tasks

### **Abstract & Contribution**

This foundational paper introduces the **Cognitive Synergy Architecture (CSA)** as a paradigmatic shift from traditional robotics toward **cognitive partnership**. The work addresses the fundamental question: *How can robots become thinking partners rather than sophisticated tools?*

**Key Technical Contributions:**
- **Unified Architecture**: Integration of semantic perception (SEGO), adaptive planning (IMAGO), and explainable control (LOGOS)
- **Real-Time Semantic Reasoning**: 15Hz scene graph construction with ontological validation
- **Explainable Policy Control**: Decision tree distillation from neural policies with natural language rationale generation
- **Human-Centric Safety**: Ontological constraint checking with human oversight protocols

**Philosophical Framework:**
The paper establishes that **explainability is not a feature but an existential condition** for cognitive partnership. When machines can account for their decisions, they transcend the boundary between tool and collaborator.

## üåê **Paper II: Semantic Perception Architecture**

### **"Cognitive Synergy Architecture: SEGO for Human-Centric Collaborative Robots"**

**Publication Details:**
- **arXiv ID**: [2506.13149](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13149)
- **Submission Date**: June 20, 2025
- **Target Venue**: IROS 2025
- **Status**: Major Revision Submitted

**Technical Documentation:**
- üìÇ **Design Document**: [SEGO Architecture Specification]((/assets/docs/SEGO_ÏÑ§Í≥ÑÎ¨∏ÏÑú.pdf))
- üèóÔ∏è **System Diagrams**: Detailed pipeline visualizations
- üìà **Benchmark Results**: Comparative analysis with state-of-the-art systems

### **Technical Deep Dive**

This paper focuses specifically on the **SEGO (Semantic Graph Ontology)** module, detailing how robots can achieve **semantic understanding** of their environment rather than mere geometric perception.

**Core Technical Innovation:**
- **Multi-Modal Fusion**: YOLOv5 object detection + StrongSORT tracking + ORB-SLAM2 localization
- **Semantic State Tensors**: Four-dimensional representation (Location, Boundary, Form, Intent)
- **Dynamic Scene Graphs**: Real-time relational network construction with persistence guarantees
- **Ontological Grounding**: OWL 2 knowledge base integration for semantic validation

### **System Pipeline Architecture**

**Stage 1: Multi-Modal Perception**
```python
class SEGOPerceptionPipeline:
    def __init__(self):
        self.yolo_detector = YOLOv5(weights='csa_custom.pt')
        self.tracker = StrongSORT(reid_weights='osnet_x1_0.pt')
        self.slam_system = ORB_SLAM2(vocab_file='ORBvoc.txt')
        
    def process_frame(self, rgb_image, depth_image):
        # Object detection and tracking
        detections = self.yolo_detector(rgb_image)
        tracked_objects = self.tracker.update(detections, rgb_image)
        
        # Spatial localization
        camera_pose = self.slam_system.track_rgbd(rgb_image, depth_image)
        
        # 3D object localization
        objects_3d = self.project_to_3d(tracked_objects, depth_image, camera_pose)
        
        return objects_3d
```

**Stage 2: Semantic Tensor Construction**
- **Locativeness (L)**: 3D position + reference frame + spatial relationships
- **Boundedness (B)**: Physical extent + affordance boundaries + interaction zones
- **Formness (F)**: Geometric descriptors + visual features + shape characteristics
- **Intentionality (I)**: Functional role + purpose classification + usage patterns

**Stage 3: Scene Graph Assembly**
- Node creation for each detected object
- Edge construction based on spatial and semantic relationships
- Temporal consistency maintenance across frames
- Knowledge base validation and enrichment

### **Experimental Results**

**Quantitative Performance:**
- **Detection Rate**: 30Hz real-time processing on NVIDIA Jetson Xavier
- **Tracking Accuracy**: 96.2% ID consistency over 1000-frame sequences
- **Localization Precision**: <3cm average error in controlled environments
- **Scene Graph Quality**: 92% accuracy compared to human-annotated ground truth

**Qualitative Achievements:**
- **Contextual Understanding**: System recognizes "cooking context" vs "cleaning context"
- **Predictive Capability**: Anticipates human actions based on object arrangements
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Modifies assistance strategy based on semantic scene analysis

## üîÆ **Paper III: Topological Semantic Reasoning**

### **"Ontology Neural Network and ORTSF: A Framework for Topological Reasoning and Delay-Robust Control"**

**Publication Details:**
- **arXiv ID**: [2506.19277](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19277)
- **Submission Date**: June 25, 2025
- **Target Venue**: Science Robotics
- **Status**: Under Review

**Research Repository:**
- üíæ **Implementation**: [ONN Framework](https://github.com/jack0682/ONN)
- üßÆ **Mathematical Proofs**: Topological stability guarantees
- üìä **Experimental Data**: Curvature analysis and homology persistence

### **Revolutionary Approach**

This paper introduces the **Ontology Neural Network (ONN)** ‚Äî a paradigmatic shift from traditional neural networks that classify isolated objects to systems that understand **relational meaning** and **topological semantics**.

**Core Mathematical Innovation:**

**Semantic State Tensor:**
$$\mathcal{S}_i(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
\mathbb{L}_i(t) \\
\mathbb{B}_i(t) \\
\mathbb{F}_i(t) \\
\mathbb{I}_i(t)
\end{bmatrix} \in \mathbb{R}^d$$

**Forman-Ricci Curvature for Context Boundaries:**
$$\text{Ric}_F(e_{ij}) = w(e_{ij}) \left[ \frac{w(v_i) + w(v_j)}{w(e_{ij})} - \sum_{e_k \sim e_{ij}} \frac{w(v_i)}{\sqrt{w(e_{ij}) w(e_k)}} \right]$$

**Persistent Homology for Meaning Preservation:**
$$d_{\text{PH}}(G_C(t), G_C(t+\delta)) \leq C_1 \sqrt{\mathcal{L}_{\text{ricci}}} + C_2 \mathcal{L}_{\text{ph}}$$

### **ORTSF: Real-Time Semantic Control**

The **Ontological Real-Time Semantic Fabric (ORTSF)** provides the critical link between semantic understanding and robotic control:

$$\Lambda_{\text{cmd}}(s) = \mathcal{C}(s) \cdot \mathcal{C}_{\text{delay}}(s) \circ \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{S}, I, G)$$

Where:
- $\mathcal{C}(s)$: Control law ensuring dynamic compliance
- $\mathcal{C}_{\text{delay}}(s)$: Delay compensation for real-time performance
- $\mathcal{P}$: Predictive operator for semantic state evolution

### **Philosophical Significance**

**ONN embodies the principle that meaning is not assigned but emergent** ‚Äî arising from the persistence of relational structure across time and transformation. This represents a fundamental shift toward **artificial wisdom** rather than mere artificial intelligence.

**Key Insights:**
- **Relational Ontology**: Objects exist only in relationship, not in isolation
- **Topological Continuity**: Meaning persists through continuous deformation of context
- **Geometric Ethics**: Semantic boundaries arise naturally from relational curvature
- **Temporal Semantics**: Understanding evolves through time while preserving essential structure

### **Experimental Validation**

**Synthetic Experiments:**
- **Noise Robustness**: 94% semantic accuracy under 30% sensor noise
- **Context Transfer**: 87% success rate in cross-domain semantic transfer
- **Temporal Consistency**: 96% meaning preservation across 500-frame sequences

**Real-World Deployments:**
- **Kitchen Environment**: Understanding cooking vs. cleaning contexts
- **Office Setting**: Distinguishing meeting vs. individual work scenarios
- **Laboratory Context**: Recognizing experimental vs. maintenance activities
