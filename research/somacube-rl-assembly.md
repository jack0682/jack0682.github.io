## 1. Introduction & Problem Formulation

### 1.1 Industrial Context and Technological Significance

The convergence of collaborative robotics and artificial intelligence represents one of the most transformative developments in modern manufacturing automation. While traditional industrial robots demonstrate exceptional precision in executing predetermined trajectories for repetitive operations, contemporary collaborative robots (cobots) must exhibit advanced capabilities including **real-time adaptability**, **human-safe interaction protocols**, and **intelligent decision-making processes** when operating in dynamic environments alongside human operators.

Recent breakthroughs in deep reinforcement learning have achieved remarkable success across diverse domains ranging from strategic game-playing systems to high-speed autonomous control and sophisticated robotic manipulation tasks. However, the application of reinforcement learning methodologies to real-world robotic assembly presents several fundamental and interconnected challenges:

**Core Technical Challenges:**

1. **Combinatorial Action Space Explosion**: Multi-component assembly tasks suffer from exponential growth in possible action combinations, creating intractable exploration spaces for traditional learning algorithms
2. **Kinematic Safety Constraints**: Six-degree-of-freedom manipulators must navigate complex joint limit boundaries and kinematic singularities while maintaining collision-free operation
3. **Real-Time Perception Integration**: Dynamic environments demand sub-second sensor fusion and decision-making capabilities for practical deployment
4. **Sim-to-Real Domain Gap**: Bridging the performance gap between idealized simulation environments and unpredictable physical deployment conditions

Each piece contributes uniquely to the combinatorial complexity of the assembly task, requiring sophisticated spatial reasoning and constraint satisfaction.*

### 1.2 Soma Cube as Benchmark Problem

The Soma Cube puzzle, conceptualized by Danish polymath Piet Hein in 1933, consists of seven distinct polycube pieces that must be assembled into a complete 3×3×3 cubic structure. This deceptively simple puzzle presents an ideal benchmark for evaluating intelligent robotic assembly systems due to its unique combination of:

**Complexity Characteristics:**
- **Geometric Constraints**: Each piece occupies 3-4 unit cubes with specific orthogonal connectivity patterns
- **Spatial Reasoning Requirements**: Assembly demands understanding of 3D spatial relationships and interference patterns  
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Placement order significantly impacts solution feasibility
- **Multiple Valid Solutions**: 240 distinct valid assembly configurations exist, requiring flexible solution strategies

**Real-World Relevance:**
Unlike simplified pick-and-place demonstrations, Soma Cube assembly mirrors critical aspects of industrial manufacturing scenarios:
- **Mechanical Component Assembly**: Automotive parts, electronic modules, precision instruments
- **Construction Automation**: Modular building systems, prefabricated structures
- **Electronic Packaging**: Circuit board assembly, component placement, cable routing
- **Pharmaceutical Manufacturing**: Capsule assembly, packaging automation

### 1.3 Mathematical Problem Formulation

#### 1.3.1 Formal Assembly Problem Definition

Let $$\mathcal{P} = \{P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_7\}$$ represent the complete set of seven Soma Cube pieces, where each piece $$P_i$$ occupies $$n_i \in \{3, 4\}$$ unit cube positions within the three-dimensional space. The target assembly space is defined as the discrete 3×3×3 grid:

$$\mathcal{G} = \{(x,y,z) : x,y,z \in \{0,1,2\}\}$$

A **valid assembly configuration** is mathematically represented as a bijective mapping:

$$\phi: \mathcal{P} \rightarrow \mathcal{G} \times \mathcal{O}$$

where $$\mathcal{O}$$ denotes the set of all valid 3D orientations for polycube pieces, subject to the following fundamental constraints:

**Completeness Constraint:**
$$\bigcup_{i=1}^{7} \text{occupied}(\phi(P_i)) = \mathcal{G}$$

**Non-Overlapping Constraint:**
$$\forall i \neq j: \text{occupied}(\phi(P_i)) \cap \text{occupied}(\phi(P_j)) = \emptyset$$

where $$\text{occupied}(\phi(P_i))$$ returns the set of grid positions occupied by piece $$P_i$$ under placement $$\phi(P_i)$$.

#### 1.3.2 Combinatorial Complexity Analysis

The theoretical action space complexity presents significant computational challenges:

**Per-Piece Orientation Analysis:**

| Piece Type | Unique Orientations | Symmetry Group | Complexity Factor |
|------------|-------------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Corner | 8 | $$C_3$$ rotational | Low |
| Positive | 24 | Full orientation space | High |
| Negative | 24 | Full orientation space | High |  
| Zee | 12 | $$D_2$$ dihedral | Medium |
| Tee | 12 | $$D_2$$ dihedral | Medium |
| Ell | 24 | Full orientation space | High |
| Three | 12 | $$D_2$$ dihedral | Medium |

**Total Theoretical Action Space:**

$$|\mathcal{A}_{theoretical}| = \sum_{i=1}^{7} |\mathcal{O}_i| \times |\mathcal{G}| = (8+24+24+12+12+24+12) \times 27 = 116 \times 27 = 3,132$$


$$\
\left\lvert \mathcal{A}_{\mathrm{feasible}} \right\rvert \approx 2484
\$$

executable actions, representing a **21% constraint-based reduction** that forms the foundation of our legal-action masking approach.


### 1.4 Markov Decision Process (MDP) Formulation

We formalize the robotic Soma Cube assembly as a finite-horizon MDP defined by the tuple $$(\mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma)$$:

#### 1.4.1 State Space Representation

The state space $$\mathcal{S}$$ encodes complete assembly configuration information as a 36-dimensional vector:

$$s_t = [\mathbf{g}_{3 \times 3 \times 3}, \mathbf{p}_7, r_{placed}, r_{index}] \in \mathbb{R}^{36}$$

**Component Breakdown:**
- $$\mathbf{g}_{3 \times 3 \times 3} \in \{0,1\}^{27}$$: Binary occupancy matrix for 3D assembly grid
- $$\mathbf{p}_7 \in \{0,1\}^7$$: One-hot encoding of currently active piece
- $$r_{placed} \in [0,1]$$: Normalized placement progress indicator  
- $$r_{index} \in [0,1]$$: Sequential ordering progress metric

#### 1.4.2 Action Space and Legal Action Masking

Each action $$a \in \mathcal{A}$$ specifies a complete placement operation:

$$a = (\text{piece\_id}, \text{orientation}, \text{position}) \in \mathcal{P} \times \mathcal{O} \times \mathcal{G}$$

**Legal Action Mask Definition:**
For any state $$s$$, the legal action mask $$\mathcal{M}(s) \subseteq \mathcal{A}$$ contains only physically feasible actions:

$$a \in \mathcal{M}(s) \iff \bigwedge_{c \in \mathcal{C}} c(s,a)$$

where $$\mathcal{C} = \{c_{collision}, c_{support}, c_{reach}, c_{vertical}\}$$ represents the comprehensive constraint set:

**Collision Avoidance:** $$c_{collision}(s,a) = [\text{occupied}(a) \cap \text{occupied}(s) = \emptyset]$$

**Support Constraint:** $$c_{support}(s,a) = [\exists \text{ stable support surface below occupied}(a)]$$

**Reachability Constraint:** $$c_{reach}(s,a) = [\exists q \in \mathcal{Q} : f_k(q) = \text{target\_pose}(a)]$$

**Vertical Access:** $$c_{vertical}(s,a) = [\text{clear vertical approach path above occupied}(a)]$$

#### 1.4.3 Reward Function Design

Our carefully crafted reward function encourages robot-friendly assembly sequences while maintaining exploration capabilities:

$$\mathcal{R}(s,a,s') = \mathcal{R}_{base} + \mathcal{R}_{ground} + \mathcal{R}_{access} + \mathcal{R}_{height} + \mathcal{R}_{logic} + \mathcal{R}_{structure}$$

**Individual Reward Components:**

$$\mathcal{R}_{base} = \begin{cases}
+100 & \text{if complete assembly achieved} \\
+10 & \text{if valid piece placement} \\
-10 & \text{if invalid placement attempt} \\
-5 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

$$\mathcal{R}_{ground} = \begin{cases}
+30 & \text{if } \min(z_{\text{occupied}}) = 0 \\
+25 & \text{if consecutive ground pieces} \leq 6 \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

$$\mathcal{R}_{access} = \begin{cases}
+8 & \text{if clear vertical access path} \\
-30 & \text{if blocked access (infeasible for robot)}
\end{cases}$$

$$\mathcal{R}_{height} = -8 \times \max(z_{\text{occupied}})$$

$$\mathcal{R}_{logic} = \begin{cases}
+15 & \text{if } \bar{z}_{\text{current}} \leq \bar{z}_{\text{previous}} \\
-15 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

$$\mathcal{R}_{structure} = 2 \times |\text{adjacent\_connections}|$$

**Modified Bellman Optimality Equation:**
With legal action masking, the optimal Q-function satisfies:

$$Q^*(s,a) = \mathcal{R}(s,a) + \gamma \max_{a' \in \mathcal{M}(s')} Q^*(s',a')$$

## 2. Related Work and Technical Background

### 2.1 Reinforcement Learning for Robotic Manipulation

#### 2.1.1 Deep Q-Networks in Discrete Control

Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) revolutionized reinforcement learning by demonstrating human-level performance in complex decision-making tasks. The fundamental DQN approach approximates the optimal action-value function:

$$Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}[R_t + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s_{t+1}, a') | s_t = s, a_t = a]$$

using deep neural networks with experience replay and target network stabilization.

**Seminal Contributions:**
- **Mnih et al. (2015)**: Original DQN achieving superhuman Atari performance
- **Van Hasselt et al. (2016)**: Double DQN addressing overestimation bias
- **Wang et al. (2016)**: Dueling architecture separating state value and advantage estimation
- **Schaul et al. (2015)**: Prioritized experience replay improving sample efficiency

**Limitations in Robotic Applications:**
Traditional DQN approaches face significant challenges when applied to robotic manipulation:

1. **Curse of Dimensionality**: Exponential action space growth with multiple objects and orientations
2. **Sparse Reward Signals**: Limited feedback in complex assembly tasks  
3. **Safety Constraints**: Lack of integration with physical system limitations
4. **Sim-to-Real Transfer**: Performance degradation when transitioning to physical robots

#### 2.1.2 Action Masking and Constraint Integration

Recent advances have explored incorporating domain knowledge through action space restrictions:

**Huang et al. (2022)** introduced masked reinforcement learning for invalid action filtering, demonstrating improved sample efficiency in game-theoretic scenarios. However, their approach focused on rule-based constraints rather than physics-based limitations.

**Nachum et al. (2018)** developed hierarchical reinforcement learning with action abstractions, reducing complexity through temporal decomposition rather than constraint-based filtering.

**Our Innovation**: We extend action masking to physics-aware constraint satisfaction, directly integrating kinematic limits, collision avoidance, and manipulation feasibility into the learning process.

### 2.2 Robotic Assembly and Puzzle Solving

#### 2.2.1 Classical Assembly Planning

Traditional assembly planning approaches rely on geometric reasoning and symbolic planning:

**Bertram et al. (2008)** developed geometric constraint satisfaction for polycube puzzles, achieving optimal solutions through systematic search but lacking integration with robotic execution constraints.

**Li et al. (2019)** explored learning-based approaches for 2D puzzle assembly, demonstrating neural network effectiveness but limited to planar configurations without physical manipulation considerations.

**Gap in Current Research**: Existing approaches typically separate logical puzzle solving from physical manipulation planning, leading to solutions that may be geometrically valid but robotically infeasible.

#### 2.2.2 6-DOF Manipulation Planning

Six-degree-of-freedom robotic manipulation presents unique challenges requiring sophisticated path planning methodologies:

**Kinematic Singularities**: Configurations where the robot Jacobian becomes singular, causing:
- Infinite joint velocities for small Cartesian motions  
- Loss of controllability in specific directions
- Potential mechanical damage from excessive joint speeds

**Joint Limit Handling**: Each robot joint $$j$$ operates within bounds $$q_j^{\min} \leq q_j \leq q_j^{\max}$$, requiring path planning algorithms to maintain feasible configurations throughout motion execution.

### 2.3 ZYZ Euler Angle Parameterization

#### 2.3.1 Mathematical Representation

The ZYZ Euler angle convention represents 3D rotations through sequential rotations about Z-Y-Z axes:

$$\mathbf{R}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \mathbf{R}_z(\alpha)\mathbf{R}_y(\beta)\mathbf{R}_z(\gamma)$$

$$= \begin{bmatrix}
\cos\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma - \sin\alpha\sin\gamma & -\cos\alpha\cos\beta\sin\gamma - \sin\alpha\cos\gamma & \cos\alpha\sin\beta \\
\sin\alpha\cos\beta\cos\gamma + \cos\alpha\sin\gamma & -\sin\alpha\cos\beta\sin\gamma + \cos\alpha\cos\gamma & \sin\alpha\sin\beta \\
-\sin\beta\cos\gamma & \sin\beta\sin\gamma & \cos\beta
\end{bmatrix}$$

#### 2.3.2 Singularity Analysis

**Gimbal Lock Conditions**: Singularities occur when $$\beta = 0$$ or $$\beta = \pi$$, causing:
- Loss of one degree of rotational freedom
- Infinite solutions for $$(\alpha, \gamma)$$ combinations
- Numerical instabilities in inverse kinematic calculations

**Traditional Mitigation Approaches**:
1. **Quaternion Representation**: Avoids Euler angle singularities but lacks intuitive interpretation
2. **Multiple Representations**: Switch between different Euler conventions based on proximity to singularities
3. **Trajectory Modification**: Plan paths avoiding singular regions

**Our Novel Contribution**: Proximity index-based detection with systematic regrasp planning maintaining ZYZ representation benefits while ensuring computational stability.

### 2.4 Human-Robot Interaction and Speech Recognition

#### 2.4.1 Multilingual Speech Recognition

Recent advances in automatic speech recognition, particularly OpenAI's Whisper architecture, have achieved remarkable accuracy across multiple languages:

**Whisper Model Architecture**:
- **Encoder-Decoder Transformer**: 99M to 1.5B parameter variants
- **Multilingual Training**: 680,000 hours of diverse audio data
- **Robust Performance**: Handles noise, accents, and domain variations

**Korean Language Challenges**:
- **Morphological Complexity**: Extensive agglutination and honorific systems
- **Phonological Variations**: Regional dialects and formal/informal speech patterns  
- **Industrial Noise**: Manufacturing environments with high SNR requirements

#### 2.4.2 Safety-Critical HRI Systems

Human-robot collaboration in industrial environments demands comprehensive safety protocols:

**International Standards**:
- **ISO 10218**: Safety requirements for industrial robots
- **ISO/TS 15066**: Collaborative robot safety specifications  
- **IEC 62061**: Functional safety of electrical/electronic systems

**Implementation Requirements**:
- Emergency stop response time < 100ms
- Force limitation for collision safety
- Workspace monitoring and intrusion detection
- Fail-safe system behavior under all conditions

### 2.5 Sim-to-Real Transfer in Robotics

#### 2.5.1 Domain Randomization Techniques

Effective sim-to-real transfer requires systematic treatment of environmental variations:

**Physical Parameter Randomization**:
- **Mass and Inertia**: ±10-20% variation in object properties
- **Friction Coefficients**: Surface interaction modeling
- **Actuator Dynamics**: Motor response characteristics and delays

**Sensor Randomization**:
- **Camera Parameters**: Intrinsic calibration variations
- **Depth Noise**: Gaussian noise modeling sensor limitations  
- **Lighting Conditions**: Illumination intensity and color temperature

**Tobin et al. (2017)** demonstrated substantial improvements in real-world robot performance through comprehensive domain randomization, achieving robust transfer across various manipulation tasks.

#### 2.5.2 Gap Analysis in Current Literature

**Identified Research Gaps**:

1. **Limited Integration Studies**: Most research focuses on individual components rather than complete system integration
2. **Simplified Environments**: Controlled laboratory conditions rather than industrial deployment scenarios  
3. **Safety Considerations**: Insufficient attention to safety-critical system requirements
4. **Scalability Questions**: Unclear scaling properties for complex multi-component assemblies

**Our Systematic Approach**: This research addresses these gaps through comprehensive system integration, real-world deployment validation, safety-first design principles, and systematic scalability analysis.

## 3. Methodology: Legal-Action Masked DQN Architecture

### 3.1 Hierarchical Deep Q-Network Design

Our legal-action masked DQN architecture employs a sophisticated hierarchical approach that decomposes the complex combinatorial action space into manageable, independently optimizable subspaces. This design philosophy draws inspiration from both dueling network architectures and factorized action representations while introducing novel constraint-aware masking mechanisms.

#### 3.1.1 Network Architecture and Mathematical Foundation

The core DQN architecture utilizes a multi-head design optimized for discrete 3D assembly tasks. The state representation $$s \in \mathbb{R}^{36}$$ encodes complete assembly configuration:

$$s = [\mathbf{g}_{3 \times 3 \times 3}, \mathbf{p}_7, r_{placed}, r_{index}] \in \mathbb{R}^{36}$$

**Feature Extraction Layer:**
The initial feature extraction employs a fully connected layer with ReLU activation:

$$\phi(s) = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}_1 s + \mathbf{b}_1)$$

where $$\mathbf{W}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{512 \times 36}$$ and $$\mathbf{b}_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{512}$$.

**Hierarchical Processing Layers:**
$$h_1 = \text{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}_2 \phi(s) + \mathbf{b}_2) \in \mathbb{R}^{256}$$
$$h_2 = \text{Dropout}(\text{ReLU}(\mathbf{W}_3 h_1 + \mathbf{b}_3), p=0.3) \in \mathbb{R}^{128}$$

**Dual-Head Architecture:**
The network separates orientation and position value estimation:

$$Q_{\text{orientation}}(s, o) = \mathbf{W}_4^{(o)} h_2 + \mathbf{b}_4^{(o)} \in \mathbb{R}^{|\mathcal{O}|}$$
$$Q_{\text{position}}(s, p) = \mathbf{W}_5^{(p)} h_2 + \mathbf{b}_5^{(p)} \in \mathbb{R}^{27}$$

**Action Value Composition:**
The final Q-value combines orientation and position estimates through additive composition:

$$Q(s, (o,p)) = Q_{\text{orientation}}(s, o) + Q_{\text{position}}(s, p)$$

#### 3.1.2 Theoretical Justification for Additive Decomposition

**Independence Assumption:** The additive decomposition assumes conditional independence of orientation and position preferences given the current state:

$$P(\text{optimal action} = (o^*, p^*) | s) \approx P(\text{optimal orientation} = o^* | s) \cdot P(\text{optimal position} = p^* | s)$$

This assumption holds for Soma Cube assembly where:
- **Orientation Selection**: Primarily constrained by geometric compatibility and piece symmetries
- **Position Selection**: Primarily constrained by spatial occupancy and support requirements

**Computational Efficiency Gain:**
The decomposition reduces network complexity from $$O(|\mathcal{O}| \times |\mathcal{G}|) = O(116 \times 27) = O(3,132)$$ parameters to $$O(|\mathcal{O}|) + O(|\mathcal{G}|) = O(116) + O(27) = O(143)$$ parameters, achieving a **22× reduction** in computational complexity.

### 3.2 Legal Action Masking: Constraint-Aware Learning

![Legal Action Masking](/assets/images/somacube-paper/legal_action_masking.png)
*Figure 4: Legal action masking visualization demonstrating constraint-based action filtering process. (a) Complete theoretical action space containing 3,132 possible action combinations, (b) Physics-based constraint filtering systematically removing collision violations and reachability constraints, (c) Final masked action set containing only 2,484 physically feasible actions, resulting in 26% improvement in learning efficiency and guaranteed solution completeness.*

#### 3.2.1 Constraint Formalization and Implementation

At each decision time step $$t$$, we compute a comprehensive binary mask 
$$
\mathcal{M}(s_t) \in \{0,1\}^{\lvert \mathcal{A} \rvert}
$$ 
representing the legality of each possible action. 

The masked Q-value computation becomes:


$$Q_{\text{masked}}(s,a) = \begin{cases}
Q(s,a) & \text{if } \mathcal{M}(s)[a] = 1 \\
-\infty & \text{if } \mathcal{M}(s)[a] = 0
\end{cases}$$

**Constraint Conjunction:** The legality mask is determined through logical conjunction of all constraint predicates:

$$\mathcal{M}(s)[a] = \bigwedge_{c \in \mathcal{C}} c(s,a) = c_{\text{collision}}(s,a) \land c_{\text{support}}(s,a) \land c_{\text{reach}}(s,a) \land c_{\text{vertical}}(s,a)$$

#### 3.2.2 Individual Constraint Implementations

**1. Collision Avoidance Constraint:**
$$c_{\text{collision}}(s,a): \text{occupied}_{\text{new}}(a) \cap \text{occupied}_{\text{existing}}(s) = \emptyset$$

Implementation uses efficient voxel-based occupancy checking with O(1) lookup time through pre-computed hash tables.

**2. Support Stability Constraint:**
$$c_{\text{support}}(s,a): \exists \text{ stable foundation below } \text{occupied}_{\text{new}}(a)$$

Checks for gravitational support through either:
- Contact with table surface ($$z_{\min} = 0$$)
- Contact with previously placed piece providing stable support

**3. Kinematic Reachability Constraint:**
$$c_{\text{reach}}(s,a): \exists \mathbf{q} \in \mathcal{Q}_{\text{feasible}} : \text{FK}(\mathbf{q}) = \text{target\_pose}(a)$$

Validates inverse kinematics solvability within joint limits:
$$\mathbf{q}_{\min} \leq \mathbf{q} \leq \mathbf{q}_{\max}$$

Uses numerical IK solver with convergence tolerance $$\epsilon = 10^{-6}$$ and maximum iteration limit of 100.

**4. Vertical Access Constraint:**
$$c_{\text{vertical}}(s,a): \text{clear\_path\_from\_above}(\text{target\_position}(a), s) = \text{True}$$

Ensures robot gripper can approach target position from above without collision with existing pieces or workspace boundaries.

#### 3.2.3 Solution Completeness Guarantee

**Theorem (Solution Completeness):** The legal action masking preserves solution completeness under physical robot constraints.

**Formal Statement:** For any valid Soma Cube solution $$\pi^* = (s_0, a_0^*, s_1, a_1^*, \ldots, s_T^*)$$ that is physically executable by the robotic system, we guarantee:

$$\forall t \in [0, T]: a_t^* \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{legal}}(s_t)$$

**Proof Sketch:** 
1. **Physical Executability Assumption**: If solution $$\pi^*$$ is physically executable, then each action $$a_t^*$$ must satisfy all physical constraints by definition
2. **Constraint Completeness**: Our constraint set $$\mathcal{C}$$ captures all fundamental physical limitations (collision, support, reachability, access)
3. **Constraint Consistency**: Each constraint predicate $$c \in \mathcal{C}$$ correctly identifies physical feasibility
4. **Therefore**: $$\pi^*$$ physically executable $$\Rightarrow$$ $$\forall t: \bigwedge_{c \in \mathcal{C}} c(s_t, a_t^*) = \text{True}$$ $$\Rightarrow$$ $$\forall t: a_t^* \in \mathcal{A}_{\text{legal}}(s_t)$$ □

### 3.3 Training Algorithm: Constrained Deep Q-Learning

#### 3.3.1 Modified DQN Update Rule

The legal-action masking requires modification of the standard DQN Bellman target computation. For each sampled transition $$(s, a, r, s', \text{done})$$ from experience replay buffer $$\mathcal{D}$$:

**Standard DQN Target:**
$$y_{\text{standard}} = r + \gamma (1 - \text{done}) \max_{a'} Q_{\theta^-}(s', a')$$

**Legal-Action Masked Target:**
$$y_{\text{masked}} = r + \gamma (1 - \text{done}) \max_{a' \in \mathcal{M}(s')} Q_{\theta^-}(s', a')$$

**Loss Function:**
$$\mathcal{L}(\theta) = \mathbb{E}_{(s,a,r,s',\text{done}) \sim \mathcal{D}}\left[(Q_\theta(s,a) - y_{\text{masked}})^2\right]$$

### 3.4 Reward Engineering for Robot-Friendly Assembly

#### 3.4.1 Multi-Objective Reward Design Philosophy

Our reward function design follows three fundamental principles:

1. **Robot Kinematic Compatibility**: Encourage assembly sequences that respect joint limits and avoid singularities
2. **Physical Stability**: Prioritize gravitationally stable and mechanically sound configurations
3. **Exploration Maintenance**: Provide sufficient reward shaping without eliminating beneficial exploration

#### 3.4.2 Detailed Reward Component Analysis

**Base Assembly Rewards:**
$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{base}}(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+100 & \text{if complete 7-piece assembly achieved} \\
+10 & \text{if valid piece placement executed} \\
+\alpha \cdot \text{density\_increase}(a) & \text{for improved spatial efficiency} \\
-\lambda \cdot \text{collision\_penalty}(a) & \text{for constraint violations} \\
-5 & \text{for no-progress actions}
\end{cases}$$

**Ground-First Assembly Incentive:**
$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{ground}}(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+30 & \text{if placed piece touches ground (}z_{\min} = 0\text{)} \\
+25 & \text{if maintaining contiguous ground layer} \\
+15 & \text{if extending ground-connected structure} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

**Vertical Accessibility Reward:**
$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{access}}(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+8 & \text{if clear vertical approach path maintained} \\
-30 & \text{if placement blocks future vertical access} \\
-20 & \text{if requires complex regrasp maneuvers}
\end{cases}$$

**Height Penalty for Stability:**
$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{height}}(s,a,s') = -8 \times \max(z_{\text{occupied}})$$

This linear height penalty encourages bottom-up assembly, reducing mechanical instability and simplifying manipulation.

**Sequential Logic Reward:**
$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{logic}}(s,a,s') = \begin{cases}
+15 & \text{if } \bar{z}_{\text{current}} \leq \bar{z}_{\text{previous}} \\
-15 & \text{if violating bottom-up principle} \\
+5 & \text{if maintaining assembly connectivity}
\end{cases}$$

**Structural Cohesion Bonus:**
$$\mathcal{R}_{\text{structure}}(s,a,s') = 2 \times |\text{adjacent\_face\_connections}|$$

Rewards adjacent cube face contact, encouraging mechanically stable configurations.

#### 3.4.3 Reward Function Validation

**Convergence Analysis:** The total reward function satisfies the Bellman optimality conditions under the constraint that $$\gamma \in (0,1)$$ and all reward components are bounded:

$$|\mathcal{R}(s,a,s')| \leq R_{\max} = 100 + 30 + 8 + 15 + 14 = 167$$

**Empirical Validation Results:**

| Reward Component | Weight | Impact on Success Rate | Impact on Assembly Time |
|------------------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| **Base Rewards** | 1.0 | +45% | Baseline |
| **Ground Incentive** | 1.0 | +18% | -25% (faster) |
| **Access Penalty** | 1.0 | +12% | -15% (fewer regrasps) |
| **Height Penalty** | 0.8 | +8% | -10% (simpler motions) |
| **Logic Reward** | 1.0 | +6% | -12% (better sequences) |
| **Structure Bonus** | 0.5 | +3% | +5% (minor overhead) |

**Combined Effect**: Integrated reward function achieves 75% success rate compared to 35% baseline sparse reward, with 18% reduction in average assembly time.

## 4. ZYZ Singularity Guard and Safe Path Planning

### 4.1 ZYZ Euler Angle Analysis and Singularity Characterization

#### 4.1.1 Mathematical Foundation of ZYZ Representation

The ZYZ Euler angle convention represents 3D rotations through sequential rotations about the Z-Y-Z axes, providing intuitive interpretation for robotic applications while introducing computational challenges at specific configurations.

**Rotation Matrix Formulation:**
$$\mathbf{R}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \mathbf{R}_z(\alpha)\mathbf{R}_y(\beta)\mathbf{R}_z(\gamma)$$

**Expanded Matrix Form:**
$$\mathbf{R}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \begin{bmatrix}
c_\alpha c_\beta c_\gamma - s_\alpha s_\gamma & -c_\alpha c_\beta s_\gamma - s_\alpha c_\gamma & c_\alpha s_\beta \\
s_\alpha c_\beta c_\gamma + c_\alpha s_\gamma & -s_\alpha c_\beta s_\gamma + c_\alpha c_\gamma & s_\alpha s_\beta \\
-s_\beta c_\gamma & s_\beta s_\gamma & c_\beta
\end{bmatrix}$$

where $$c_\theta = \cos(\theta)$$ and $$s_\theta = \sin(\theta)$$.

#### 4.1.2 Singularity Conditions and Computational Impact

**Gimbal Lock Phenomenon:** Singularities occur when $$\beta = 0°$$ or $$\beta = ±180°$$, causing:

1. **Rotational DOF Loss**: The first and third rotation axes become parallel, eliminating one degree of rotational freedom
2. **Parameter Indeterminacy**: Infinite solutions exist for $$(\alpha, \gamma)$$ combinations satisfying $$\alpha + \gamma = \text{constant}$$
3. **Numerical Instability**: Small changes in target orientation near singularities can cause large joint velocities

**Jacobian Analysis Near Singularities:**
The angular velocity mapping near singularities exhibits conditioning problems:

$$\boldsymbol{\omega} = \mathbf{J}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) \begin{bmatrix} \dot{\alpha} \\ \dot{\beta} \\ \dot{\gamma} \end{bmatrix}$$

where the Jacobian $$\mathbf{J}$$ becomes singular when $$\sin(\beta) \rightarrow 0$$.

**Condition Number Analysis:**
$$\kappa(\mathbf{J}) = \frac{\sigma_{\max}(\mathbf{J})}{\sigma_{\min}(\mathbf{J})} \rightarrow \infty \text{ as } |\beta| \rightarrow 0°$$

### 4.2 Proximity Index for Singularity Detection

#### 4.2.1 Novel Proximity Index Formulation

We introduce a **proximity index** (PI) to quantify nearness to singular configurations:

$$\text{PI}(\beta) = 1 - |\cos(\beta)|$$

**Key Properties:**
- $$\text{PI}(\beta) \in [0, 1]$$
- $$\text{PI}(\beta) = 0$$ when $$\beta = 0°, 180°$$ (singular configurations)  
- $$\text{PI}(\beta) = 1$$ when $$\beta = ±90°$$ (maximally stable configurations)
- Monotonic relationship with singularity distance

**Threshold-Based Detection:**
$$\text{SingularityRisk}(\beta) = \begin{cases}
\text{HIGH} & \text{if } \text{PI}(\beta) < 0.1 \\
\text{MEDIUM} & \text{if } 0.1 \leq \text{PI}(\beta) < 0.3 \\
\text{LOW} & \text{if } \text{PI}(\beta) \geq 0.3
\end{cases}$$

#### 4.2.2 Predictive Singularity Avoidance

**Trajectory Safety Assessment:**
For a planned motion from current orientation $$\mathbf{R}_{\text{current}}$$ to target $$\mathbf{R}_{\text{target}}$$:

1. **Extract Intermediate ZYZ Angles**: Compute ZYZ representation at multiple trajectory points
2. **Evaluate Proximity Index**: Calculate $$\text{PI}(\beta_i)$$ for each intermediate configuration
3. **Safety Classification**: Classify trajectory based on minimum proximity index

$$\text{TrajectorySafety} = \min_{i \in \text{trajectory}} \text{PI}(\beta_i)$$

**Proactive Intervention Criteria:**
- **Safe Execution**: $$\text{TrajectorySafety} > 0.3$$ → Direct motion
- **Caution Required**: $$0.1 < \text{TrajectorySafety} \leq 0.3$$ → Velocity reduction + monitoring  
- **Regrasp Mandatory**: $$\text{TrajectorySafety} \leq 0.1$$ → Activate systematic regrasp sequence

### 4.3 Safe ZYZ Regrasp Algorithm

#### 4.3.1 Systematic Regrasp Planning Strategy

When direct motion would traverse singular regions, our algorithm decomposes the desired rotation into safe, sequential motions with intermediate regrasps.

**Algorithm 2: Safe ZYZ Regrasp with Singularity Avoidance**

```
Input: Target pose T_target, Current pose T_current, Safety threshold ε = 0.1
Output: Safe motion sequence M

1:  Extract target ZYZ: (α_t, β_t, γ_t) ← ExtractZYZ(T_target)
2:  Compute proximity index: PI(β_t) ← 1 - |cos(β_t)|
3:  
4:  // Singularity guard activation
5:  if PI(β_t) < ε or |β_t ± 90°| < ε then
6:      β_t ← sign(β_t) × 89.9°  // Clamp to safe region
7:  
8:  // Initialize motion sequence
9:  M ← []
10: 
11: // Calculate rotation difference
12: ΔR ← T_target.R · T_current.R^(-1)
13: (k̂, θ) ← AxisAngleDecomposition(ΔR)
14: 
15: // Assess rotation magnitude and singularity risk
16: if |θ| > θ_max OR TrajectoryPI(T_current → T_target) < ε then
17:     // Decompose dangerous rotation
18:     M.append(MOVE_TO_REGRASP_POSITION)
19:     M.append(OPEN_GRIPPER)
20:     
21:     // Split rotation into safe increments
22:     n_steps ← ceil(|θ| / θ_max)
23:     for i = 1 to n_steps do
24:         θ_i ← (i / n_steps) × θ
25:         R_i ← AxisAngleToMatrix(k̂, θ_i)
26:         M.append(ROTATE_TO(R_i))
27:         if i < n_steps then
28:             M.append(CLOSE_GRIPPER)
29:             M.append(OPEN_GRIPPER)  // Intermediate regrasp
30:     
31:     M.append(CLOSE_GRIPPER)
32: else
33:     // Safe direct rotation
34:     M.append(ROTATE_DIRECTLY(ΔR))
35: 
36: // Joint limit safety verification
37: for each motion m ∈ M do
38:     q ← InverseKinematics(m.pose)
39:     if ∃j: q_j ∉ [q_{j,min} + δ, q_{j,max} - δ] then
40:         M.insert_before(m, MOVE_TO_SAFE_CONFIGURATION)
41: 
42: return M
```

#### 4.3.2 Regrasp Minimization Strategy

**Optimization Objective:** Minimize the number of regrasp operations while maintaining safety:

$$\min_{M} |\{m \in M : m = \text{REGRASP}\}|$$

subject to:
- $$\forall m \in M: \text{PI}(\text{ZYZ}(m)) \geq \epsilon_{\text{safety}}$$
- $$\forall m \in M: \mathbf{q}_{\min} \leq \text{IK}(m) \leq \mathbf{q}_{\max}$$
- $$\forall m \in M: \text{CollisionFree}(m) = \text{True}$$

**Heuristic Solution Approach:**

1. **Greedy Angle Decomposition**: Split large rotations ($$|\theta| > 90°$$) into maximum safe increments
2. **Intermediate Configuration Planning**: Select regrasp poses that minimize subsequent motion complexity  
3. **Joint Space Optimization**: Verify each planned motion maintains joint space feasibility

#### 4.3.3 Performance Analysis and Validation

**Computational Complexity:**
- **Direct Motion Planning**: $$O(1)$$ for safe trajectories
- **Regrasp Sequence Planning**: $$O(n)$$ where $$n = \lceil|\theta|/\theta_{\max}\rceil$$
- **Joint Limit Verification**: $$O(|M|)$$ per planned sequence

**Experimental Validation Results:**

| Test Scenario | Success Rate (%) | Avg. Regrasps | Execution Time (s) |

#### 4.5.1 Comprehensive Safety Testing Protocol

**Test Scenarios:**
1. **Extreme Orientations**: Systematic testing of orientations near $$\beta = 0°, ±90°, 180°$$
2. **Continuous Trajectories**: Long rotation sequences crossing multiple singular regions

#### 5.1.2 Statistical Analysis of Learning Dynamics

![Reward Distribution](/assets/images/somacube-paper/reward_histogram.png)
*Figure 7: Reward distribution histogram revealing tri-modal behavior with distinct peaks at 580 (partial assembly), 600 (advanced assembly), and 1180 (complete assembly) points, demonstrating diverse solution strategies and multi-modal convergence patterns rather than single optimum convergence.*

**Comprehensive Statistical Metrics:**
- **Mean Reward**: $$\mu_{\text{reward}} = 775.38$$
- **Reward Standard Deviation**: $$\sigma_{\text{reward}} = 312.41$$  
- **Reward-Length Correlation**: $$r_{\text{reward,length}} = 0.495$$
- **Loss-Episode Correlation**: $$r_{\text{loss,episode}} = 0.521$$

**Multi-Modal Analysis:** The reward distribution exhibits three distinct peaks:

1. **Partial Assembly Mode (~580 points)**: 2-4 pieces successfully placed
2. **Advanced Assembly Mode (~600 points)**: 5-6 pieces with structural coherence  
3. **Complete Assembly Mode (~1180 points)**: Full 7-piece successful completion

This tri-modal distribution indicates sophisticated strategy diversity rather than convergence to a single local optimum, providing robustness benefits in real-world deployment scenarios.

## 6. 실험

This section presents comprehensive experimental validation of the proposed Soma Cube assembly system, evaluating both simulation-based DQN learning performance and real-world deployment on the Doosan M0609 collaborative robot.

### 6.1 Experimental Protocol

#### 6.1.1 Training and Evaluation Framework

Experimental validation follows a comprehensive protocol encompassing both simulation-based DQN training and real-world deployment verification. Training consists of 100,000 simulation episodes with episode termination conditions:
- (1) Successful puzzle completion
- (2) Reaching 1,000 action steps
- (3) Detection of impossible states (floating pieces)

Actual robot invocation occurs selectively based on internal policy evaluation. When the RL agent's success flag transitions to True (indicating high-confidence assembly completion), the system executes the planned sequence on the physical robot. This selective deployment protocol results in 5,247 actual robot policy invocations from 100,000 total simulation episodes, representing a 5.2% sim-to-real execution ratio that balances learning efficiency with hardware verification.

#### 6.1.2 Success Criteria and Metrics

Assembly success requires all 7 Soma Cube pieces placed within the 3×3×3 target grid without overlaps or gaps. Position accuracy thresholds are set to ±1.8mm considering gripper compliance and piece manufacturing tolerances. Temporal performance requires completion within 100ms control cycles to maintain real-time responsiveness in human-robot collaboration scenarios.

#### 6.1.3 Statistical Evaluation Methodology

Performance evaluation uses 300 independent trials with randomized initial piece configurations to achieve statistical significance. Each trial includes complete system reset, piece randomization, and multi-modal sensor calibration. Success rate calculations exclude trials terminated due to hardware malfunction (power interruptions, sensor disconnections) to focus on algorithmic performance assessment.

Statistical analysis uses binomial confidence intervals for success rate estimation. With n=300 trials and observed success rate p=75%, the 95% confidence interval is calculated as:

$$CI_{95\%} = p \pm z_{0.025}\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{n}} = 0.75 \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{0.75 \times 0.25}{300}} = [0.701, 0.799]$$

This yields a confidence interval of 75% ±4.9%, providing robust statistical validation of system performance claims with acceptable precision for practical deployment considerations.

### 6.2 Experimental Setup

#### 6.2.1 Hardware Configuration

The experimental platform consists of a Doosan M0609 6-DOF collaborative robot (6kg payload, 900mm reach, ±0.05mm repeatability) equipped with an OnRobot RG2 2F gripper (110mm stroke, force control capability) and Intel RealSense D435i RGB-D camera (0.1-10m depth range, 30fps). The setup includes safety barriers, lighting systems, and designated areas for piece storage and final assembly targets. Workspace dimensions are 270mm × 270mm to accommodate the 3×3×3 Soma Cube target configuration and surrounding piece placement areas.

#### 6.2.2 Software Stack

The system operates on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS with ROS2 Humble middleware, utilizing Doosan Robot SDK for motion control and MoveIt2 for collision detection. The DQN agent is implemented with PyTorch 1.13 with CUDA 11.8 acceleration. Global mapping visualization uses Unity 2022.3 LTS with real-time ROS-Unity bridge communication for point cloud rendering.

#### 6.2.3 Soma Cube Dataset

The training dataset comprises 220 labeled RGB-D images captured across 4 lighting conditions (natural, LED, fluorescent, mixed), 5 camera angles (frontal, 30°, 45°, 60°, side), and 11 piece arrangement patterns. Each image contains an average of 4.3 blocks, resulting in 946 total bounding box annotations with 97.2% inter-annotator agreement. Data augmentation techniques (rotation ±15°, brightness ±20%, Gaussian noise σ=0.02) expanded the dataset to 1,100 training samples.

- 20 에피소드마다 목표 네트워크 업데이트
- 50,000 경험의 재생 버퍼 크기

#### 6.3.3 보상 함수 설계

보상 구조는 탐색과 작업 완성의 균형을 맞춘다:

$$r(s,a) = \begin{cases}
+100 & \text{퍼즐 완성 시} \\
+1 & \text{유효한 배치가 밀도를 증가시킬 시} \\
-5 \sim -10 & \text{무효한 행동 시} \\
0 & \text{그 외의 경우}
\end{cases}$$

## 7. Results and Discussion

This section presents quantitative results from the integrated Soma Cube assembly system, analyzing both component-level performance and end-to-end assembly effectiveness on the Doosan M0609 platform. Our extensive evaluation covers 105,300 training episodes across three curriculum levels, demonstrating substantial improvements over baseline approaches.

### 7.1 Learning Performance Analysis

#### 7.1.1 Training Convergence and Curriculum Learning

Our hierarchical DQN training with curriculum learning demonstrates remarkable efficiency across three progressive difficulty levels:

**Level 1 (2-piece assembly):** Achieved perfect convergence with 100% success rate within 500 episodes. The agent rapidly mastered basic placement constraints and collision avoidance, establishing fundamental manipulation skills.

**Level 2 (3-piece assembly):** Maintained high performance with 92.9% success rate over 1,600 episodes. The average reward of 873.2 points with an average episode length of 4.99 steps indicates consistent optimal solution discovery with efficient action selection.

**Level 3 (7-piece complete assembly):** Achieved 39.9% success rate with average reward of 775.5 points over 102,100 episodes. The extensive training at this level represents 96.97% of total episodes, highlighting the complexity scaling from partial to complete assembly.

![Training Progress](/assets/images/somacube-paper/success_per_episode.png)
*Training progress showing success rate evolution across 105,300 episodes with curriculum learning*

#### 7.1.2 Statistical Analysis of Learning Dynamics

Comprehensive statistical analysis of 105,300 episodes reveals sophisticated learning patterns:

$$\begin{align}
\mu_{\text{reward}} &= 775.38, \quad \sigma_{\text{reward}} = 312.41\\
\text{Correlation}(\text{reward}, \text{length}) &= 0.495\\
\text{Correlation}(\text{loss}, \text{episode}) &= 0.521
\end{align}$$

The moderate positive correlation between reward and episode length (r=0.495) indicates that successful assemblies tend to require more deliberate, longer sequences rather than greedy immediate placement. This validates our reward shaping that encourages systematic assembly approaches.

![Reward Distribution](/assets/images/somacube-paper/reward_histogram.png)
*Reward distribution showing trimodal behavior with distinct peaks at 580 (partial), 600 (advanced), 1180 (complete) points*

The reward distribution exhibits a trimodal shape with distinct peaks:
- **Failure Mode (~580 points):** Partial assemblies with 2-4 pieces placed
- **Near-Success Mode (~600 points):** Advanced assemblies with 5-6 pieces
- **Success Mode (~1180 points):** Complete 7-piece assemblies

This multi-modal structure demonstrates agent discovery of qualitatively different solution strategies rather than convergence to a single local optimum.

#### 7.1.3 Loss Function Analysis and Convergence

DQN training loss shows convergence with characteristic 2-4k episode oscillations, stabilizing near episode 35,000 with EWMA convergence. The persistent oscillations suggest the agent continues beneficial exploration even after policy stabilization, contributing to robustness rather than indicating training instability.

![Loss Evolution](/assets/images/somacube-paper/loss_over_episode.png)
*DQN training loss evolution showing convergence with beneficial exploration oscillations*

### 7.2 Component Performance Evaluation

#### 7.2.1 Vision System Accuracy

Object detection results across all 7 Soma Cube piece classes achieve an overall mAP@50 of 97%, demonstrating robust visual recognition:
- Rectangle: 99%
- Z-shape: 96%
- T-shape: 95%
- L-shape: 94%
- Remaining pieces: 95-98%

The L-shaped piece shows slightly lower accuracy due to ambiguous edge boundaries among complex orientations.

Pose estimation accuracy maintains ±1.8mm standard deviation at 0.8m working distance, meeting the ±2mm target specification. Hand-Eye calibration contributes 1.2mm RMS error, and coordinate transformation accumulates additional error up to 2.1mm total uncertainty, approaching but not exceeding design tolerances.

#### 7.2.2 Path Planning Effectiveness

ZYZ singularity avoidance successfully prevents computational instabilities in 95.7% of test cases (47 out of 49 trials), compared to 0% success without singularity guards. The proximity index threshold ε = 0.1 effectively detects approaching singularities while adding only 1.1% computational overhead (0.4ms) to pose calculation time.

Regrasp minimization sequencing reduces unnecessary movements by 35% compared to direct regrasp attempts, decreasing average regrasp time from 12.7 seconds to 8.3 seconds. Path smoothness improves significantly with jerk reduction from 15.2 rad/s³ to 8.7 rad/s³, contributing to more natural robot motion and reduced mechanical stress.

### 7.3 System Integration Results

#### 7.3.1 End-to-End Assembly Performance

Comprehensive evaluation across 300 assembly attempts yields 75.0% ±4.9% overall success rate (95% CI: [70.1%, 79.9%]), representing substantial improvement from the pre-optimization baseline of 35.2%. Progress through optimization stages achieved most significant gains from environmental constraint addition (+26 percentage points) and regrasp algorithm implementation (+12 percentage points).

Assembly completion time averages 12.3 ± 1.8 minutes (target: <15 minutes) with position accuracy of ±1.8mm and grasp success rate of 89%. The system demonstrates consistent performance across 3-hour continuous operation sessions, maintaining 73% success rate even after extended use, indicating adequate thermal and mechanical stability.

#### 7.3.2 Simulation-to-Real Transfer Analysis

Sim-to-real differences represent critical validation metrics for practical deployment:

| Performance Metric | Simulation | Real Robot | Difference (%) |
|-------------------|------------|-------------|----------------|
| Success Rate (%) | 82.4 ± 3.1 | 75.0 ± 4.9 | -7.4 |
| Average Assembly Time (min) | 9.8 ± 1.2 | 12.3 ± 1.8 | +25.5 |
| Trajectory Length (actions) | 14.2 ± 2.3 | 18.7 ± 3.1 | +31.7 |
| Pose Accuracy (mm RMS) | 0.8 ± 0.2 | 1.8 ± 0.4 | +125.0 |
| Motion Jerk (rad/s³) | 5.2 ± 1.1 | 8.7 ± 2.3 | +67.3 |
| Regrasp Frequency | 0.9 ± 0.3 | 1.4 ± 0.3 | +55.6 |
| **Overall Transfer Efficiency** | **91.0%** | -- | **-9.0%** |

The 7.4% success rate degradation from simulation to real deployment demonstrates effective domain transfer, with major performance losses attributed to:
1. Sensor noise and calibration uncertainties contributing to pose accuracy degradation
2. Mechanical compliance and actuator dynamics increasing trajectory execution time  
3. Real collision avoidance requiring additional safety margins

The 91.0% overall transfer efficiency validates the fidelity of the simulation environment while highlighting specific improvement areas in physics modeling and sensorimotor uncertainty representation.
