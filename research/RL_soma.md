## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Research Motivation and Industrial Context

The contemporary landscape of industrial automation stands at a critical inflection point. Traditional robotic systems, primarily designed for repetitive tasks with predetermined parameters, are increasingly inadequate for the evolving demands of modern manufacturing. The transition from mass production to mass customization necessitates robotic systems capable of **autonomous decision-making**, **real-time adaptation**, and **seamless human collaboration**.

## 2. Related Work and Theoretical Foundation

### 2.1 Collaborative Robotics: State of the Art

The field of collaborative robotics has evolved through several distinct phases, each characterized by different technological paradigms and application domains.

*Figure 4: Timeline from reactive safety systems → proactive monitoring → adaptive collaboration → predictive intelligent collaboration*

### 2.2 Assembly Automation: Challenges and Approaches

#### 2.2.1 Traditional Assembly Automation Limitations

Classical industrial assembly systems exhibit several fundamental limitations that motivate the transition to collaborative approaches:

**Geometric Constraints and Uncertainty** Traditional systems assume:

- Perfect part positioning (±0.05mm typical tolerance)
- Invariant environmental conditions
- Predetermined assembly sequences

Reality introduces:

- Part variation within manufacturing tolerances (±0.5mm typical)
- Environmental disturbances (vibration, temperature variation)
- Dynamic obstacle configurations

**Mathematical Formulation of Assembly Uncertainty**

Let $$\mathbf{T}_{\text{nominal}} \in \mathrm{SE}(3)$$ represent the nominal transformation for part placement, 
and $$\mathbf{T}_{\text{actual}}$$ the actual transformation. The assembly uncertainty can be modeled as:

$$
\Delta \mathbf{T} = \mathbf{T}_{\text{actual}} \, \mathbf{T}_{\text{nominal}}^{-1}
$$

$$\mathbf{T}_{\text{actual}} = \mathbf{T}_{\text{nominal}} \cdot \exp(\boldsymbol{\xi})$$

where $$\boldsymbol{\xi} \in \mathfrak{se}(3)$$ represents the uncertainty in the Lie algebra, typically following:

$$\boldsymbol{\xi} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \boldsymbol{\Sigma})$$

Traditional systems fail when $$\lvert \boldsymbol{\xi} \rvert > \varepsilon_{\text{tolerance}}$$ , necessitating adaptive approaches.

#### 2.2.2 Contemporary Adaptive Assembly Approaches

**Vision-Guided Assembly** Recent advances in computer vision have enabled real-time pose estimation for assembly tasks:

- **Template Matching**: Cross-correlation based approaches with computational complexity $$O(n^2)$$ for template size $$n$$
- **Feature-Based Methods**: SIFT, SURF, ORB descriptors with matching complexity $$O(m \log m)$$ for $$m$$ features
- **Deep Learning Approaches**: CNN-based pose estimation with end-to-end learning

**Performance Comparison**:

|Method|Accuracy|Speed|Robustness|
|---|---|---|---|
|Template Matching|±1mm|10-50ms|Low (lighting sensitive)|
|Feature-Based|±2mm|5-20ms|Medium (texture dependent)|
|Deep Learning|±0.5mm|1-10ms|High (requires training data)|

**Force-Guided Assembly** Incorporating force/torque feedback for contact-rich assembly tasks:

$$\mathbf{F}_{contact} = \mathbf{K}_{contact} \cdot \mathbf{x}_{penetration}$$

where $$\mathbf{K}_{contact}$$ represents the contact stiffness matrix and $$\mathbf{x}_{penetration}$$ the penetration depth vector.

Compliance control strategies:

- **Impedance Control**: $$\mathbf{M}\ddot{\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{B}\dot{\mathbf{x}} + \mathbf{K}\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{F}_{external}$$
- **Admittance Control**: $$\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{G}(\mathbf{F}_{external} - \mathbf{F}_{desired})$$

### 2.3 The Soma Cube as a Robotics Benchmark

#### 2.3.1 Problem Complexity Analysis

The Soma cube puzzle, consisting of seven three-dimensional pieces that must be assembled into a 3×3×3 cube, presents unique challenges that make it an ideal benchmark for collaborative robotic systems.

![Soma Cube Pieces and Complexity Analysis](/assets/images/soma/soma_cube_pieces_analysis.png)  
*Figure 5: Detailed visualization of all seven Soma cube pieces with their geometric properties, degrees of freedom, and assembly constraints*

**Mathematical Problem Formulation**

Let $$\mathcal{P} = \{P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_7\}$$ represent the set of Soma cube pieces, where each piece $P_i$ is defined as a set of unit cubes:

$$P_i = \{(x_j, y_j, z_j) \in \mathbb{Z}^3 \mid j = 1, \ldots, n_i\}$$

where $$n_i$$ is the number of unit cubes in piece $$P_i$$ (ranging from 3 to 4).

The assembly problem can be formulated as finding transformations $$$\mathbf{T}_i \in SE(3)$$ such that:

$$\bigcup_{i=1}^{7} \mathbf{T}_i(P_i) = \mathcal{C}_{3 \times 3 \times 3}$$

with the constraints:

1. **Non-overlap**: $$\mathbf{T}_i(P_i) \cap \mathbf{T}_j(P_j) = \emptyset$$ for $$i \neq j$$
2. **Complete coverage**: $$\bigcup_{i=1}^{7} \mathbf{T}_i(P_i) = {(x,y,z) : x,y,z \in {0,1,2}}$$
3. **Rigid body constraints**: $$\mathbf{T}_i \in SE(3)$$ (rotations and translations only)

**Computational Complexity**

The discrete version of the problem has computational complexity:

$$|\mathcal{S}| = \prod_{i=1}^{7} |O_i| \times 27^7$$

where $$\lvert O_i \rvert$$ is the number of unique orientations for piece $$P_i$$ (typically 24 for asymmetric pieces, fewer for symmetric ones), and $$27^7$$ represents the possible positions within the $$3\times 3\times 3$$ grid.

This yields approximately $$\lvert O_1 \rvert \times \lvert O_2 \rvert \times \cdots \times \lvert O_7 \rvert \times 27^7 \approx 10^{12}$$ possible configurations, making exhaustive search intractable.

#### 2.3.2 Robotics-Specific Challenges

Beyond the combinatorial complexity, robotic assembly introduces additional challenges:

**Perception Challenges**

- **Occlusion Handling**: Partial visibility of pieces during assembly
- **Scale Ambiguity**: Distinguishing between pieces with similar shapes
- **Lighting Variation**: Robust recognition under varying illumination conditions

**Manipulation Challenges**

- **Non-uniform Geometry**: Each piece has different optimal grasp configurations
- **Precision Requirements**: Assembly tolerances typically ≤1mm for successful fit
- **Collision Avoidance**: Complex 3D spatial reasoning for obstacle-free motion

**Planning Challenges**

- **Assembly Sequence Optimization**: Order of placement affects feasibility
- **Workspace Constraints**: Limited robot reach and dexterity considerations
- **Real-time Adaptation**: Responding to unexpected configurations or failures

### 2.4 Machine Learning in Robotics: Current Paradigms

#### 2.4.1 Reinforcement Learning for Manipulation

Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for learning complex manipulation strategies. The fundamental framework can be expressed as a Markov Decision Process (MDP):

$$\langle \mathcal{S}, \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{P}, \mathcal{R}, \gamma \rangle$$

where:

- $$\mathcal{S}$$: State space (robot configuration, object poses, environmental conditions)
- $$\mathcal{A}$$: Action space (joint velocities, end-effector commands, grasp actions)
- $$\mathcal{P}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \times \mathcal{S} \rightarrow [0,1]$$: Transition probability function
- $$\mathcal{R}: \mathcal{S} \times \mathcal{A} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$$: Reward function
- $$\gamma \in [0,1]$$: Discount factor

**Value Function Approximation**

The optimal action-value function $$Q^*(s,a)$$ satisfies the Bellman optimality equation:

$$Q^*(s,a) = \mathbb{E}[r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a') | s,a]$$

In practice, this is approximated using neural networks:

$$Q(s,a;\theta) \approx Q^*(s,a)$$

where $$\theta$$ represents the network parameters optimized through temporal difference learning:

$$\theta_{t+1} = \theta_t + \alpha \nabla_\theta \left[(r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s',a';\theta^-) - Q(s,a;\theta))^2\right]$$

#### 2.4.2 Deep Learning for Robotic Perception

**Convolutional Neural Networks for Object Detection**

Modern object detection systems typically follow the YOLO (You Only Look Once) paradigm:

$$P(\text{object}, \text{class}, \text{bbox}) = \sigma(\mathbf{W} \cdot \phi(\mathbf{I}) + \mathbf{b})$$

where:

- $$\mathbf{I}$$: Input image
- $$\phi(\cdot)$$: Feature extraction function (typically a CNN backbone)
- $$\mathbf{W}, \mathbf{b}$$: Learned parameters
- $$\sigma(\cdot)$$: Sigmoid activation for probability outputs

**Loss Function Design**

The YOLO loss function combines multiple objectives:

$$\mathcal{L} = \lambda_{coord}\mathcal{L}_{coord} + \lambda_{conf}\mathcal{L}_{conf} + \lambda_{class}\mathcal{L}_{class}$$

where:

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{coord}} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}\mathbb{I}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}[(x_i - \hat{x}_i)^2 + (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2 + (\sqrt{w_i} - \sqrt{\hat{w}_i})^2 + (\sqrt{h_i} - \sqrt{\hat{h}_i})^2]$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{\text{conf}} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\sum_{j=0}^{B}[\mathbb{I}_{ij}^{\text{obj}}(C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2 + \lambda_{\text{noobj}}\mathbb{I}_{ij}^{\text{noobj}}(C_i - \hat{C}_i)^2]$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{class} = \sum_{i=0}^{S^2}\mathbb{I}_i^{obj}\sum_{c \in classes}(p_i(c) - \hat{p}_i(c))^2$$

## 3. System Architecture and Design Methodology

### 3.1 Overall System Architecture

Our robotic assembly system follows a hierarchical, multi-layered architecture designed to achieve seamless integration between perception, planning, control, and human interaction subsystems. The architecture is built upon the principle of **separation of concerns** while maintaining tight coupling where necessary for real-time performance.

![Complete System Architecture Diagram](/assets/images/soma/system_architecture.png)  
*Figure 8: Comprehensive system architecture showing all hardware and software components, data flow, and control loops with timing constraints*

#### 3.1.1 Architectural Design Principles

**Principle 1: Hierarchical Decomposition** The system is organized into four primary layers:

1. **Sensing Layer**: Raw data acquisition and preprocessing
2. **Perception Layer**: Scene understanding and object state estimation
3. **Planning Layer**: Task decomposition and motion planning
4. **Control Layer**: Real-time robot control and execution

**Principle 2: Real-time Constraints** Each layer operates under specific timing constraints:

$$\tau_{\text{sensing}} \leq 33\text{ms} \quad (30 \text{Hz})$$
$$\tau_{\text{perception}} \leq 100\text{ms} \quad (10 \text{Hz})$$
$$\tau_{\text{planning}} \leq 500\text{ms} \quad (2 \text{Hz})$$
$$\tau_{\text{control}} \leq 1\text{ms} \quad (1000 \text{Hz})$$

**Principle 3: Fault Tolerance and Recovery** Each subsystem implements local error detection and recovery mechanisms:

- **Graceful Degradation**: Reduced functionality under component failures
- **Redundant Sensing**: Multiple sensors for critical measurements
- **Exception Handling**: Systematic error propagation and recovery protocols

#### 3.1.2 Hardware System Configuration

![Hardware Setup and Specifications](/assets/images/soma/hardware_setup_specs.png)  
*Figure 9: Detailed technical drawings of the complete hardware setup including dimensional specifications, coordinate frames, and calibration targets*

|Component|Model|Specifications|Role|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Manipulator**|Doosan M0609|6-DOF, 900mm reach, 0.05mm repeatability, 9kg payload|Primary manipulation|
|**End Effector**|OnRobot RG2|110mm stroke, 40N grip force, position/force control|Adaptive grasping|
|**Vision System**|Intel RealSense D435i|RGB-D + IMU, 0.1-10m range, 1280×720@30fps|Scene perception|
|**Compute Platform**|NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier|32GB RAM, 512-core Volta GPU, ARM64 architecture|Real-time processing|
|**Communication**|Ethernet + USB 3.0|1Gbps + 5Gbps bandwidth|Data transmission|

**Kinematic Analysis**

The Doosan M0609 manipulator workspace can be characterized by the forward kinematics:

$$\mathbf{T}_{0}^{6} = \prod_{i=1}^{6} \mathbf{T}_{i-1}^{i}(\theta_i)$$

where each transformation $$\mathbf{T}_{i-1}^{i}$$ follows the Denavit-Hartenberg convention:

$$\mathbf{T}_{i-1}^{i} = \begin{bmatrix} 
c_i & -s_i c_{\alpha_i} & s_i s_{\alpha_i} & a_i c_i \\
s_i & c_i c_{\alpha_i} & -c_i s_{\alpha_i} & a_i s_i \\
0 & s_{\alpha_i} & c_{\alpha_i} & d_i \\
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 
\end{bmatrix}$$

**DH Parameters for Doosan M0609**:

|Joint|$$a_i$$ (mm)|$$\alpha_i$$ (rad)|$$d_i$$ (mm)|$$\theta_i$$ (rad)|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|1|0|0|151.9|$$\theta_1$$|
|2|0|$$\pi/2$$|0|$$\theta_2 - \pi/2$$|
|3|409|0|0|$$\theta_3$$|
|4|367|0|122.3|$$\theta_4$$|
|5|0|$$\pi/2$$|0|$$\theta_5$$|
|6|0|$$-\pi/2$$|133|$$\theta_6$$|

**Workspace Volume Calculation**

The reachable workspace volume can be computed through numerical integration:

$$V_{\text{workspace}} = \iiint_{\mathcal{W}} dx \, dy \, dz$$

where $$\mathcal{W}$$ is the set of all reachable positions. For the M0609, this yields approximately $$V_{workspace} \approx 2.3 m^3$$.

### 3.2 Software Architecture and Framework

#### 3.2.1 ROS2-Based Distributed System

The software architecture is built upon ROS2 (Robot Operating System 2) Humble distribution, providing:

- **DDS-based Communication**: Data Distribution Service for real-time, reliable messaging
- **Lifecycle Management**: Systematic node startup, configuration, and shutdown
- **Quality of Service**: Configurable reliability, durability, and timing constraints

**Core Node Architecture**:

**Algorithm 1: Lifecycle Node Management**

```
procedure LIFECYCLE_NODE_STARTUP
    configure() → Load parameters, initialize resources
    activate() → Start processing, enable communication
    if failure then
        deactivate() → Stop processing, maintain state
        cleanup() → Release resources
    end if
end procedure
```

#### 3.2.2 Real-time Performance Optimization

**Thread Management and Scheduling**

Critical real-time performance is achieved through careful thread management with FIFO scheduling and priority assignment.

**Performance Monitoring**

Integrated performance monitoring provides real-time feedback:

$$\text{Performance Index} = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \mathbb{I}(\tau_i < \tau_{deadline})$$

where $$\tau_i$$ is the $$i$$-th execution time and $$\tau_{deadline}$$ is the real-time deadline.

### 3.3 Sensor Fusion and Calibration Framework

#### 3.3.1 Multi-Modal Sensor Integration

**Sensor Synchronization**

Temporal alignment of multi-modal sensor data is critical for accurate perception:

$$t_{sync} = \arg\min_t \sum_{s \in \mathcal{S}} |t - t_s|^2$$

where $$\mathcal{S}$$ is the set of sensor timestamps and $$t_s$$ is the timestamp for sensor $$s$$ .

#### 3.3.2 Camera-Robot Calibration

**Hand-Eye Calibration Problem**

The hand-eye calibration problem seeks to find the transformation $$\mathbf{T}_{gripper}^{camera}$$ such that:

$$\mathbf{T}_{base}^{camera} = \mathbf{T}_{base}^{gripper} \cdot \mathbf{T}_{gripper}^{camera}$$


**Mathematical Formulation**

Given $n$ calibration poses, we have the constraint equations:

$$\mathbf{A}_i \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{X} \mathbf{B}_i \quad \text{for } i = 1, \ldots, n$$

where:

- $$\mathbf{A}_i = (\mathbf{T}_{base}^{gripper})_i^{-1} \cdot (\mathbf{T}_{base}^{gripper})_{i+1}$$ (gripper motion)
- $$\mathbf{B}_i = (\mathbf{T}_{camera}^{target})_i \cdot (\mathbf{T}_{camera}^{target})_{i+1}^{-1}$$ (camera observation)
- $$\mathbf{X} = \mathbf{T}_{gripper}^{camera}$$ (unknown transformation)

**Solution Method: Tsai-Lenz Algorithm**

The rotation component is solved first using:

$$\mathbf{R}_A \mathbf{R}_X = \mathbf{R}_X \mathbf{R}_B$$

This can be reformulated as a linear system in rotation vector form.

**Calibration Accuracy Assessment**

The calibration quality is assessed using:

$$E_{reprojection} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\mathbf{p}_{observed,i} - \pi(\mathbf{T}_{calibrated} \cdot \mathbf{P}_{world,i})|^2$$

where $$\pi(\cdot)$$ is the camera projection function and $$\mathbf{P}_{world,i}$$ are known 3D calibration points.

**Uncertainty Quantification**

The calibration uncertainty is characterized through bootstrap analysis:

$$\boldsymbol{\Sigma}_{calibration} = \frac{1}{B-1} \sum_{b=1}^{B} (\mathbf{T}_b - \overline{\mathbf{T}})(\mathbf{T}_b - \overline{\mathbf{T}})^T$$

where $$\mathbf{T}_b$$ are calibration results from $$B$$ bootstrap samples.

- Basic geometric filtering based on size and aspect ratio

**Stage 2: Fine Classification**

- CNN-based classification of detected regions
- Geometric verification using 3D constraints
- Confidence scoring and threshold-based filtering

#### 4.2.2 Deep Learning Architecture for Piece Classification

**Network Architecture: Modified ResNet-18**

```
Input Layer: 224×224×3 RGB images
├── Conv Block 1: 64 filters, 7×7 kernel, stride 2
├── Max Pool: 3×3 kernel, stride 2
├── Residual Block 1: [64, 64] × 2
├── Residual Block 2: [128, 128] × 2

├── Dropout: p=0.5
└── Output Layer: 128 → 7 (classes)
```

**Training Methodology**

The network is trained using synthetic data augmentation:

$$\mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{classification} + \lambda_{reg} \mathcal{L}_{regularization}$$

where:

$$\mathcal{L}_{classification} = -\sum_{i=1}^{7} y_i \log(\hat{y}_i)$$

$$\mathcal{L}_{regularization} = |\theta|_2^2$$

**Data Augmentation Strategy**

- Geometric transformations: rotation (±45°), scaling (0.8-1.2×), translation (±20px)
- Photometric variations: brightness (±20%), contrast (±20%), saturation (±30%)
- Noise injection: Gaussian noise (σ=0.05), salt-and-pepper noise (p=0.01)

### 4.3 6-DOF Pose Estimation

#### 4.3.1 Pose Estimation Algorithm

**PnP-based Approach**

Given a set of 2D-3D correspondences, the pose estimation problem is formulated as:

$$\min_{\mathbf{R}, \mathbf{t}} \sum_{i=1}^{n} |\mathbf{p}_i - \pi(\mathbf{K}(\mathbf{R}\mathbf{P}_i + \mathbf{t}))|^2$$

where:

- $$\mathbf{p}_i$$: 2D image points
- $$\mathbf{P}_i$$: 3D model points
- $$\pi(\cdot)$$: Camera projection function
- $$\mathbf{K}$$: Camera intrinsic matrix

**RANSAC Integration**

To handle outliers, we employ RANSAC with adaptive threshold:

$$\theta_{adaptive} = \theta_{base} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{\sigma_{image}^2 + \sigma_{projection}^2}{2}}$$

**Algorithm 3: Robust Pose Estimation**

```python
procedure ESTIMATE_POSE(image_points, model_points):
    best_pose ← null
    best_inlier_count ← 0
    
    for iteration ← 1 to MAX_ITERATIONS:
        subset ← RANDOM_SAMPLE(4, correspondences)
        pose ← SOLVE_P4P(subset)
        inliers ← COUNT_INLIERS(pose, ALL_CORRESPONDENCES)
        
        if inliers > best_inlier_count:
            best_pose ← pose
            best_inlier_count ← inliers
    
    refined_pose ← REFINE_POSE(best_pose, inliers)
    return refined_pose
```

#### 4.3.2 Uncertainty Quantification

**Covariance Estimation**

The pose uncertainty is estimated using the Fisher Information Matrix:

$$\mathbf{C}_{\mathbf{x}} = \sigma^2 (\mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{J})^{-1}$$

where $$\mathbf{J}$$ is the Jacobian of the reprojection function with respect to pose parameters.

**Propagation to End-Effector**

The uncertainty propagates through the kinematic chain:

$$\mathbf{C}_{\text{end}} = \mathbf{J}_{\text{kin}} \mathbf{C}_{\text{pose}} \mathbf{J}_{\text{kin}}^T$$

## 5. Motion Planning and Control

### 5.1 Hierarchical Motion Planning Architecture

#### 5.1.1 Task-Level Planning

**High-Level State Machine**

The assembly task is decomposed into discrete states:

```
States: {IDLE, SCANNING, GRASPING, MOVING, PLACING, VERIFICATION}
Events: {START, OBJECT_DETECTED, GRASP_SUCCESS, MOTION_COMPLETE, ASSEMBLY_VERIFIED}
```

**State Transition Logic**

$$\delta: Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$$

where $$Q$$ is the state set and $$\Sigma$$ is the event alphabet.

#### 5.1.2 Motion-Level Planning

**RRT*-based Path Planning**

The motion planning employs RRT* (Rapidly-exploring Random Tree Star) for optimal path generation:

**Algorithm 4: RRT* Motion Planning**

```python
procedure RRT_STAR(start, goal, obstacles):

### 5.2 Singularity Avoidance and Pose Interpolation

#### 5.2.1 Mathematical Analysis of Singularities

**ZYZ Euler Angle Singularities**

For ZYZ Euler angle representation $$(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$$, singularities occur when:

$$\sin(\beta) = 0 \Rightarrow \beta = 0 \text{ or } \beta = \pi$$

**Rotation Matrix Formulation**

$$\mathbf{R}_{ZYZ}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma) = \mathbf{R}_z(\alpha) \mathbf{R}_y(\beta) \mathbf{R}_z(\gamma)$$

**Singularity Detection**

$$\text{Singularity Index} = |\sin(\beta)|$$

**Avoidance Strategy**

When $$\lvert \sin(\beta) \rvert < \epsilon_{threshold}$$:

1. **Quaternion Interpolation**: Switch to quaternion representation
    
    $$\mathbf{q}(t) = \text{slerp}(\mathbf{q}_1, \mathbf{q}_2, t)$$
    
2. **Alternative Euler Convention**: Use XYZ or ZXZ conventions
    
3. **Regrasp Planning**: Modify approach trajectory
    

#### 5.2.2 Optimal Trajectory Generation

**Minimum Time Trajectory**

The trajectory optimization problem:

$$\min_{T, \mathbf{q}(t)} T$$

subject to:

- Kinematic constraints: $$\mathbf{q}(0) = \mathbf{q}_{start}$$, $$\mathbf{q}(T) = \mathbf{q}_{goal}$$  
- Velocity limits: $$\lvert \dot{\mathbf{q}}(t) \rvert \leq \dot{\mathbf{q}}_{max}$$  
- Acceleration limits: $$\lvert \ddot{\mathbf{q}}(t) \rvert \leq \ddot{\mathbf{q}}_{max}$$  
- Obstacle avoidance: $$d(\mathbf{q}(t), \mathcal{O}) \geq d_{safe}$$

**Spline-based Parameterization**

Trajectories are parameterized using quintic B-splines:

$$\mathbf{q}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \mathbf{c}_i B_i^5(t)$$

where $$\mathbf{c}_i$$ are control points and $$B_i^5(t)$$ are quintic B-spline basis functions.

### 5.3 Force Control and Compliant Manipulation

#### 5.3.1 Hybrid Position-Force Control

**Control Architecture**

The hybrid controller combines position and force control in orthogonal directions:

$$\mathbf{S} \mathbf{u}_{position} + (\mathbf{I} - \mathbf{S}) \mathbf{u}_{force} = \mathbf{u}_{total}$$

where $$\mathbf{S}$$ is the selection matrix defining controlled directions.

**Force Control Law**

$$\mathbf{u}_{force} = \mathbf{K}_p (\mathbf{F}_{desired} - \mathbf{F}_{measured}) + \mathbf{K}_i \int (\mathbf{F}_{desired} - \mathbf{F}_{measured}) dt$$

**Position Control Law**

$$\mathbf{u}_{position} = \mathbf{K}_p (\mathbf{x}_{desired} - \mathbf{x}_{measured}) + \mathbf{K}_d (\dot{\mathbf{x}}_{desired} - \dot{\mathbf{x}}_{measured})$$

#### 5.3.2 Adaptive Grasping Strategy

**Grasp Quality Metrics**

The grasp quality is evaluated using:

$$Q_{grasp} = \min_{|\mathbf{w}|=1} |\mathbf{G}^T \mathbf{w}|$$

where $$\mathbf{G}$$ is the grasp matrix and $$\mathbf{w}$$ is a unit wrench.

**Force Closure Analysis**

A grasp achieves force closure if:

$$\exists \mathbf{f} > 0 : \mathbf{G} \mathbf{f} = \mathbf{w}_{external}$$

for any external wrench $$\mathbf{w}_{external}$$.

2. **Efficiency Reward**
    
    $$R_{efficiency} = -\lambda_{time} \Delta t - \lambda_{energy} |\dot{\mathbf{q}}|^2$$
    
3. **Safety Reward**
    
    $$R_{safety} = -\mu \mathbb{I}(\text{collision}) - \nu \mathbb{I}(\text{singularity})$$
    
4. **Completion Reward**
    
    $$R_{completion} = \rho \mathbb{I}(\text{puzzle solved})$$

#### 9.1.2 Scientific Insights

**Perception-Action Loop Optimization** The experimental results reveal that the perception-action loop performance is critically dependent on temporal synchronization. The 30Hz vision update rate provides sufficient information for the 2Hz planning cycle, but higher frequencies yield diminishing returns due to computational constraints.

**Learning vs. Programming Trade-offs** The reinforcement learning approach shows superior adaptability but requires extensive training. The 75% success rate represents a significant improvement over traditional approaches (45%) while remaining below human performance (98%), indicating substantial room for future improvements.
