# Cover Letter

## Hello everyone!

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Robotics Engineer position at your company. As a Mechanical Engineering graduate specializing in collaborative robotics and artificial intelligence, I bring both theoretical knowledge and extensive practical experience in developing intelligent automation solutions that bridge the gap between academic research and industrial applications.

## Core Strengths and Professional Characteristics

### Exceptional Execution Speed and Action-Oriented Mindset

My greatest strength lies in rapid implementation and action-oriented thinking. When faced with complex problems, I prioritize quick identification of core ideas and immediate execution over excessive planning. During drone development projects with the aerospace society, I adopted a "rapid prototyping" approach—building functional prototypes even when theoretical designs weren't perfect, then improving through practical testing. This iterative methodology consistently proved more efficient than traditional development processes.

### Superior Adaptability and Flexible Problem-Solving

I excel in adapting to changing situations and turning unexpected challenges into opportunities. During Janus particle generation experiments in the fluid mechanics laboratory, when results deviated from expectations, I immediately formulated new hypotheses and adjusted experimental conditions rather than adhering to original plans. This flexible response approach often led to more interesting research discoveries and demonstrates my ability to thrive in the rapidly evolving robotics field.

### Team Leadership and Motivation Excellence

As a team leader, I consistently drive momentum and motivate team members through concrete action and personal example. When projects stagnated or team members faced difficulties, I provided specific action items and led by demonstration to restore team momentum. As club president, I focused on achievable short-term goals rather than abstract long-term visions, ensuring team members experienced regular success and maintained motivation.

### Continuous Improvement and Self-Awareness

I recognize that my focus on rapid execution can sometimes lead to insufficient detail management. To address this, I've implemented a checklist-based quality management system and established personal processes that ensure thorough review phases follow rapid implementation. For documentation improvement, I practice concurrent logging and regular consolidation of these records into comprehensive project documentation.

## Current Research Position and Activities

### Currently: Undergraduate Researcher at Intelligent Robotics Laboratory

I am currently working on a sophisticated "Hidden Object Finding with Manipulator" project based on reinforcement learning at the Intelligent Robotics Laboratory. This project requires integration of computer vision, reinforcement learning, and robotics control technologies, representing a cutting-edge research challenge in autonomous manipulation.

In the current development phase, I focus on environment modeling and reward function design. I'm developing a novel approach that transcends traditional visual-information-dependent methods by combining haptic feedback with predictive reasoning. The goal is to enable robot manipulators to intelligently search for and manipulate visually occluded objects—a capability with significant implications for real-world manufacturing applications.

### Previous Research: Fluid Mechanics Laboratory

As an undergraduate researcher in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory, I conducted research on Electrohydrodynamics (EHD) and Janus particle generation using 3D-printed Y-shaped channels. This experience provided me with precise understanding of microscopic phenomena and experimental design methodologies. The mutual verification between CFD simulation of microfluidic phenomena and experimental results developed my ability to understand and correct theory-reality gaps.
