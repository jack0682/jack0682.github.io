## Introduction: One Proposition, Foundation of All Philosophy

"Perception accompanies interpretation"—this seemingly simple proposition may be the most fundamental and revolutionary discovery in the history of philosophy. This report conducts a comprehensive analysis of the ontological, epistemological, and methodological implications of this proposition, examining its destructive impact on traditional philosophical systems.

This proposition is not merely a philosophical claim. It is a transcendental principle that simultaneously defines the conditions and limits of all philosophical inquiry, possessing absolute certainty that cannot be deconstructed by itself.

## Chapter 1: Structural Analysis of the Proposition

### 1.1 Deconstruction of Components

#### 1.1.1 The Problematic Nature of 'Perception'
The concept of 'perception' has traditionally presupposed a dualistic structure of subject and object. Perception was understood as an act whereby a perceiving subject grasps a perceived object. However, in this proposition, 'perception' transcends such structural presuppositions.

Perception is no longer an active act of the subject or passive reception from an object. It is a more primordial event that occurs before, or together with, the subject-object distinction. Perception is both an encounter with the world and a construction of the world, simultaneously a discovery of the self and a creation of the self.

#### 1.1.2 The Fundamental Meaning of 'Interpretation'
'Interpretation' is not simply a secondary activity of assigning meaning or providing explanation. In this proposition, interpretation is an ontological event that occurs simultaneously and necessarily with perception.

Interpretation is not a relationship between original and copy, but rather a primordial mode of relationship between world and being. To borrow Heidegger's expression, interpretation is the way beings understand themselves in Being. We exist because we interpret, and we interpret because we exist.

#### 1.1.3 The Ontological Meaning of 'Accompanies'
The expression 'accompanies' indicates that perception and interpretation cannot be separated temporally or logically. This is not simple simultaneity or causal relationship. It is ontological co-originality.

Neither interpretation without perception nor perception without interpretation exists. They are distinguished but not separated, presupposing each other while exceeding each other. This relationship shows a structure similar to Merleau-Ponty's concept of chiasm or Derrida's concept of différance.

### 1.2 Formal Characteristics of the Proposition

#### 1.2.1 Self-Reference and Self-Proof
This proposition has a unique self-referential structure. The very attempt to understand the proposition already executes the content of the proposition. The moment we perceive the proposition, we interpret it, and this act of interpretation proves the truth of the proposition.

This is different from general self-referential paradoxes. While paradoxical sentences like "This sentence is false" generate contradictions, our proposition reinforces itself. Even attempts to negate it have the paradoxical structure of confirming its truth.

#### 1.2.2 Indeconstructibility
Traditionally, philosophical propositions could be decomposed into simpler components. However, this proposition refuses such analytical approach. The moment we try to analyze 'perception,' we are already interpreting it; the moment we try to deconstruct 'interpretation,' we are already perceiving it.

This indeconstructibility is not a logical or methodological limitation but ontological necessity. The proposition holds the status of the most atomic unit of thought, like an indivisible particle of thinking.

## Chapter 2: Historical Context and Precursors

### 2.1 Anticipations in Ancient Philosophy

#### 2.1.1 Heraclitus's Logos
Heraclitus's concept of logos shows an ancient precursor to this proposition. His proposition "everything flows" emphasized relationships and processes rather than fixed beings. Logos was not simply reason or law, but a principle through which the world and humans mutually interpret and mutually constitute each other.

For Heraclitus, the world was a riddle to be interpreted, and simultaneously something that revealed itself through the act of interpretation. This was an insight that anticipated the accompaniment of perception and interpretation.

#### 2.1.2 Reinterpretation of Plato's Cave Allegory
Plato's cave allegory has traditionally been interpreted as a distinction between true reality and shadow-like phenomena. However, from our perspective, this allegory shows the inseparability of perception and interpretation.

The prisoners in the cave interpret shadows as 'reality.' The freed prisoner sees firelight and reaches new interpretation. The one who has seen the sun arrives at yet another interpretation. What's important is that at each stage, 'pure perception' does not exist, and all perception occurs within a specific interpretive horizon.

#### 2.1.3 Augustine's Sign Theory
Augustine saw in "On Christian Doctrine" that all perception occurs through the interpretation of signs. For him, the world was one vast text, and human perception was the interpretive act of reading that text.

This perspective shows that perception is not neutral reflection but active interpretive work. Augustine's distinction between "signs and things" can be called a theological version of perception-interpretation accompaniment.

### 2.2 Modern Philosophy's Turning Points

#### 2.2.1 Kant's Copernican Revolution
Kant's critical philosophy becomes a direct precursor to our proposition. Kant argued that perception does not conform to objects, but objects conform to perception. This means all perception is interpretation through the subject's a priori forms.

Pure reason's categories and space-time's intuitive forms are all frameworks of interpretation. We cannot directly perceive things-in-themselves, only objects constructed through our perceptual forms in the phenomenal world. For Kant, perception was already interpretation.

#### 2.2.2 Hegel's Dialectical Movement
Hegel's dialectic unfolds the accompaniment of perception and interpretation as a dynamic process. In the phenomenology of consciousness, consciousness attempts to perceive objects, but changes itself in the process of perception. Perception is interpretation, and interpretation gives birth to new perception.

The entire process leading to absolute spirit is a spiral movement of perception-interpretation. At each stage, consciousness objectifies its interpretation and re-interprets that objectified thing.

### 2.3 Modern Philosophy's Hermeneutical Turn

#### 2.3.1 Heidegger's Ontological Hermeneutics
Heidegger elevated hermeneutics from the methodological dimension to the ontological dimension. In "Being and Time," the basic structure of Dasein is "understanding," and understanding is essentially interpretive.

Dasein is always already thrown into an interpreted world and projects its possibilities of being within that world. Perception is only a derivative mode of this interpretive structure. For Heidegger, "to be" itself meant "to interpret."

#### 2.3.2 Gadamer's Philosophical Hermeneutics
Gadamer inherited Heidegger's insight and grasped understanding as a historical and linguistic event. In "Truth and Method," he saw that all understanding starts from the horizon of pre-understanding, and in the process of understanding, the horizons of interpreter and text fuse.

For Gadamer, perception is always historically conditioned interpretation. Objective perception is an illusion, and all perception is an interpretive event that occurs within a specific tradition and language.

## Chapter 3: Ontological Implications

### 3.1 Identity of Being and Interpretation

#### 3.1.1 The Interpretive Character of Being Itself
Our proposition demands fundamental change in ontology. Traditionally, being was considered to precede interpretation, as the object or ground of interpretation. However, the proposition "perception accompanies interpretation" implies that being itself has an interpretive structure.

To be is to be interpreted, and to interpret is to be. Being and interpretation are not separate realms but two aspects of the same event. This resonates with Heidegger's proposition that "being is always the being of beings."

#### 3.1.2 Deconstruction of the Concept of Substance
Traditional metaphysics' concept of substance (substantia) is deconstructed before this proposition. Substance was understood as existing independently and being the substrate of accidental properties. However, if all perception accompanies interpretation, what we call substance is also merely an interpretive construction.

Whether Aristotle's primary substance, Spinoza's unique substance, or Leibniz's monads—all concepts of substance have meaning only within specific interpretive frameworks. Substance is not discovered but constructed through interpretation.

#### 3.1.3 Emergence of Relational Ontology
The accompaniment of perception-interpretation implies relational ontology. Beings do not exist independently and then form relationships; they exist in relationships. And those relationships are relationships of mutual interpretation.

When A perceives B, A interprets B, and simultaneously A itself changes through this interpretive act. Perception-interpretation is not unilateral but mutual. The world is not a collection of individual beings but a network of mutual interpretation.

### 3.2 Temporality and Interpretation

#### 3.2.1 Interpretive Construction of Time
Time does not flow objectively but is constructed through interpretation. The past is the past interpreted from the present perspective, and the future is the future interpreted through present projection. Even the present is the present interpreted within the horizon of past and future.

Similar to Heidegger's ecstatic temporality, time unfolds through Dasein's interpretive structure. Time is not given but interpreted.

#### 3.2.2 Historicity and Tradition
History is not an objective record of the past but a present interpretive construction. We cannot perceive the past "as it was" and always only interpret it from the present horizon. Even historical facts are established only within specific interpretive paradigms.

Tradition is not simple succession but creative interpretation. Each generation newly interprets tradition and transforms tradition through that interpretation. Tradition is a living chain of interpretation.

---

## Chapter 4: Epistemological Revolution

### 4.1 Deconstruction of Subject-Object Distinction

#### 4.1.1 The Problem of the Knowing Subject
In traditional epistemology, the knowing subject was the starting point and foundation of the cognitive process. Whether Descartes' cogito or Kant's transcendental ego, the knowing subject was presupposed to have stable identity. However, if perception accompanies interpretation, the knowing subject itself is also a product of interpretation.

The subject interprets itself in the process of perception and constitutes itself through that interpretation. Subjectivity is not given but achieved. I become me by interpreting me.

#### 4.1.2 Deconstruction of the Object
Similarly, the cognitive object does not exist independently. The object is constituted through the subject's perception-interpretation. As Kant showed, what we perceive is not things-in-themselves but phenomena.

But even phenomena are not neutral givens. Phenomena appear within specific interpretive frameworks. The same event can appear as different phenomena in different interpretive horizons.

#### 4.1.3 Mutual Constitution
Subject and object are mutually constitutive. As the subject perceives-interprets the object, the object also forms the subject. This is a dialectical process.

For example, when I appreciate a work of art, I interpret the work while the work changes me. Interpretation is not unidirectional but interaction.

### 4.2 Reconstruction of the Concept of Truth

#### 4.2.1 Limits of Correspondence Theory
Traditional correspondence theory of truth sees the agreement between proposition and fact as truth. However, if facts themselves are constructed through interpretation, pure facts do not exist. What we call facts are already interpreted facts.

The "reality before interpretation" presupposed by correspondence theory is merely an inaccessible assumption. We are always already within interpretation and cannot go outside interpretation.

#### 4.2.2 Reinterpretation of Coherence Theory
Coherence theory sees the consistency among propositions as the criterion of truth. This is more compatible with the accompaniment of perception-interpretation. Interpretation always occurs within relationships with other interpretations.

However, coherence theory also does not sufficiently capture the creative aspect of interpretation. Consistency emphasizes maintaining existing interpretive systems, but interpretation sometimes destroys existing systems and creates new systems.

#### 4.2.3 The Eventual Character of Truth
Following Heidegger's concept of truth, truth can be understood as an event of disclosure (aletheia). Truth is not possessed but happens. The event of new meaning opening through interpretation is truth itself.

In this concept of truth, error also becomes a necessary moment of truth. Error is a productive moment that opens the possibility of new interpretation.

## Chapter 5: Philosophy of Language Dimension

### 5.1 Identity of Language and Interpretation

#### 5.1.1 The Interpretive Nature of Language
Wittgenstein's later philosophy grasped language use as social practice. Language games follow rules, but those rules themselves are applied through interpretation. The same rule can be interpreted differently in different contexts.

Wittgenstein's proposition that meaning is use aligns with the idea that meaning is constructed through interpretation. Language is not a means of conveying fixed meanings but an activity of creating meaning.

#### 5.1.2 Indeterminacy of Translation
Quine's thesis of indeterminacy of translation clearly shows the interpretive character of language. The same linguistic behavior can be explained by different translation manuals. This shows that meaning is not completely determined by behavior.

Translation is creation, not discovery. The translator does not find the meaning of the original text but constructs meaning between two languages.

#### 5.1.3 Productivity of Language
Language is not simply a means of expression but a force that constitutes thought and reality. As the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis suggests, language forms the way we perceive and interpret the world.

New linguistic expressions open new possibilities of perception. When a poet creates a new metaphor, they are not simply expressing existing meaning but creating new meaning.

### 5.2 Text and Interpretation

#### 5.2.1 Autonomy and Openness of Text
According to Ricoeur's textual hermeneutics, text becomes autonomous existence when separated from the author. However, this autonomy does not mean having fixed meaning. Rather, text is open to infinite possibilities of interpretation.

The encounter between text and reader causes a new meaning event each time. The same text is read differently by different readers, in different times. This is because text is realized only through interpretation.

#### 5.2.2 Creative Character of Reading
Reading is not passive reception but active meaning construction. The reader dialogues with the text and reaches new understanding through that dialogue. Reading is not discovering the meaning of the text but creating meaning with the text.

From this perspective, the diversity of interpretation is not a defect but shows the richness of the text. That one text can give birth to countless interpretations means the meaning of the text is infinite.

## Chapter 6: Aesthetic Implications

### 6.1 Relationship between Art and Interpretation

#### 6.1.1 Mode of Existence of Artistic Works
An artistic work is more than a material object. It is an existence that is completed only through appreciation. The meaning of an artistic work is not in the artist's intention but is generated in the encounter between work and appreciator.

According to Ingarden's phenomenological aesthetics, an artistic work is realized as an intentional object only through concretization. The same work is concretized differently for different appreciators, and this diversity creates the richness of the work.

#### 6.1.2 The Interpretive Character of Aesthetic Experience
Aesthetic experience is not simple sensory pleasure but a process of meaning construction. To feel beauty is to interpret an object in a specific way.

Even in Kant's aesthetic judgment, aesthetic experience is described as the free play of imagination and understanding. This play is a kind of interpretive activity. We do not conceptualize aesthetic objects, but we experience them as meaningful.

#### 6.1.3 The Truth Function of Art
Heidegger saw art as a place where truth happens. Artistic works open new worlds and overturn existing interpretations, presenting new possibilities of interpretation.

Van Gogh's painting of shoes does not simply represent shoes but reveals a world of peasant life. This shows that art has the power to interpret and reconstruct reality.

---

## Chapter 7: Philosophy of Science Challenges

### 7.1 Reexamination of Scientific Objectivity

#### 7.1.1 Theory-Ladenness of Observation
Hanson's criticism of the observation-theory dualism shows that all observation is theoretically contaminated. Pure observation does not exist, and all observation is interpreted within specific theoretical frameworks.

When Galileo "observed" Jupiter's moons through a telescope, he was not simply seeing but interpreting from the perspective of the Copernican system. Observation was already interpretation.

#### 7.1.2 The Interpretive Function of Paradigms
Kuhn's paradigm theory shows the historicity of scientific interpretation. Paradigms are frameworks through which scientists perceive and interpret the world. When paradigms change, the same phenomena are seen differently.

The transition from Newtonian mechanics to relativity theory was not simple theory replacement but a fundamental change in world interpretation. Understanding of space-time, matter, and energy completely changed.

#### 7.1.3 Limits of Scientific Realism
Scientific realism sees science as describing independently existing reality. However, if perception accompanies interpretation, what science approaches is only interpreted reality.

Like van Fraassen's constructive empiricism, only the empirical adequacy of scientific theories can be confirmed. Whether theories accurately describe unobservable reality cannot be known.

---

## Chapter 8: Ethical Dimension

### 8.1 Ethics of Interpretation

#### 8.1.1 Responsibility of Interpretation
If all perception accompanies interpretation, we must take responsibility for interpretation. Interpretation is not a neutral activity but an act with ethical implications.

How we interpret others affects the being of others. Prejudiced interpretation can distort and oppress others. The ethics of interpretation is responsibility for others.

#### 8.1.2 Tolerance and Interpretive Humility
Recognizing the diversity of interpretation becomes the foundation of tolerance. The recognition that my interpretation is not the only truth enables an open attitude toward other interpretations.

However, this does not lead to relativism. Not all interpretations are equal, but dialogue and criticism between interpretations are necessary.

#### 8.1.3 Interpretive Justice
Justice is also a matter of interpretation. What is just is interpreted differently according to social context and historical situation. Justice is not discovered but constructed.

But this does not mean the arbitrariness of justice. Justice must be continuously reconstructed through community reflection and dialogue.

---

## Chapter 9: Psychological Perspectives

### 9.1 Cognitive Psychology and Interpretation

#### 9.1.1 Schema and Interpretive Frameworks
Cognitive psychology's schema theory shows that humans interpret new information through existing knowledge structures. Schema is both a framework of interpretation and a result of interpretation.

Bartlett's memory research shows that memory is reconstructive interpretation, not simple reproduction. We do not remember the past as it was but reinterpret it from the present perspective.

#### 9.1.2 Cognitive Biases and Distortion of Interpretation
Cognitive biases (confirmation bias, availability heuristic, representativeness heuristic, etc.) show systematic distortions of interpretation. Our interpretation is not rational and is influenced by various biases.

However, these biases may also have had evolutionarily adaptive functions. Bias may not be an error of interpretation but a useful interpretive strategy in specific environments.

---

## Chapter 10: Sociological Viewpoint

### 10.1 Construction of Social Reality

#### 10.1.1 Berger and Luckmann's Constructivism
In "The Social Construction of Reality," Berger and Luckmann show that the reality of everyday life is socially constructed. Social facts that we take for granted are products of historically formed interpretation.

Institutions, roles, identities, etc., are all created and maintained through mutual interpretation of social members. Society is not objectively existing but the result of subjective interpretations being objectified.

#### 10.1.2 Habermas's Lifeworld
Habermas's concept of lifeworld refers to the horizon of interpretation that becomes the background of communicative action. Lifeworld consists of three domains—culture, society, and personality—each reproduced interpretively.

Culture is a reservoir of meaning, society is a source of solidarity, and personality is the foundation of identity. All three domains are continuously renewed through communicative interpretation.

---

## Chapter 11: Political Philosophy Implications

### 11.1 Power and Interpretation

#### 11.1.1 The Concept of Interpretive Power
Power is not only physical coercion but the ability to control interpretation. The ability to define what is true and legitimate is the core of power.

Gramsci's concept of hegemony well shows this interpretive power. The ruling class makes its interpretation universal through cultural leadership rather than physical coercion.

#### 11.1.2 Politics of Discourse
Discourse is not simple language but interpretive practice that constitutes reality. Politics is struggle over which discourse will become dominant.

Laclau and Mouffe's radical democracy theory sees politics as hegemonic struggle over the fixation of meaning. Social identities are constructed through discursive interpretation.

---

## Chapter 12: Religious Philosophy Dimension

### 12.1 Religious Experience and Interpretation

#### 12.1.1 Hermeneutics of Mystical Experience
Mystical experience is considered direct experience difficult to express in language. However, such experience is also understood within the interpretive framework of specific religious traditions.

The experience of Christian mystics and the experience of Buddhist practitioners may be formally similar but have different meanings in different interpretive contexts.

#### 12.1.2 Hermeneutics of Scripture
Religious scriptures have meaning only through interpretation. The same scripture has been interpreted differently according to times and communities. The history of scripture is a history of interpretation.

The history of Christian biblical interpretation, Buddhist sutra interpretation, and Islamic Quranic interpretation all show the diversity and creativity of interpretation.

---

## Chapter 13: Eastern Philosophical Perspectives

### 13.1 Buddhist Emptiness and Interpretation

#### 13.1.1 Dependent Origination and Interpretive Ontology
Buddhism's dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) shows that all beings are established interdependently. This denies independent substance and presents relational ontology.

From the perspective of dependent origination, all perception is also established in relationship with other factors. The perceiver and the perceived object are also interdependently constituted.

#### 13.1.2 Emptiness and the Emptiness of Interpretation
The Madhyamaka school's emptiness (śūnyatā) thought sees that all phenomena do not have inherent nature. This can be understood to mean that everything is established only through interpretation.

Nagarjuna's Mūlamadhyamakakārikā shows the limits of language and thought. Ultimate truth transcends linguistic interpretation, but shows the paradox that even this can only be indicated through language.

### 13.2 Confucian Hermeneutical Tradition

#### 13.2.1 Tradition of Scriptural Interpretation
Confucianism was from the beginning a tradition of scriptural interpretation. The Analects, Mencius, etc., are results of later generations interpreting Confucius's words, and Neo-Confucianism is a reinterpretation of these scriptures.

The meaning of scriptures is not fixed, and each era newly interprets according to its own problematic consciousness. The history of Confucianism is a history of scriptural interpretation.

### 13.3 Daoist Non-Action and Interpretation

#### 13.3.1 The Uninterpretability of the Dao De Jing
The Dao De Jing is a text that refuses interpretation. "The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao" means that the Dao that can be spoken is not the true Dao. However, this claim itself is also one interpretation.

Daoism faces the paradox of having to express the limits of interpretation while recognizing those limits. Even non-speech (wu yan) is a kind of language.

---

## Chapter 14: Contemporary Developments and Challenges

### 14.1 Postmodern Deconstruction

#### 14.1.1 Derrida's Deconstructionism Revisited
Derrida's deconstruction critiques Western metaphysics' logocentrism. However, deconstruction itself is also an interpretive strategy. Even justice as "the undeconstructible" is a product of deconstruction.

Différance infinitely defers the definiteness of meaning. This shows the infinity of interpretation but simultaneously confirms the inevitability of the act of interpretation itself.

#### 14.1.2 Lyotard's Language Games
Lyotard sees modern society as competition among various language games. Each language game has its own rules and interpretive methods. The end of metanarratives means the impossibility of unified interpretation.

However, translation and communication between language games continue. Complete severance is impossible, and mutual understanding occurs through partial translation.

### 14.2 Cognitive Science and Interpretation

#### 14.2.1 Embodied Cognition and Interpretation
The development of cognitive science shows that cognition is not limited to the brain but depends on the whole body and even interaction with the environment. Perception is embodied and situated interpretation.

Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of the body has gained scientific support. Perception is not abstract information processing but concrete bodily interpretive activity.

#### 14.2.2 Predictive Processing and Interpretation
Recent neuroscience sees the brain not as a passive receiver but as an active predictive organ. The brain constantly generates and tests hypotheses. This scientifically supports that all perception is interpretive.

Bayesian brain theory sees perception as a probabilistic inference process. Perception is interpretive inference based on prior knowledge.

---

## Chapter 15: Educational Implications

### 15.1 Relationship between Education and Interpretation

#### 15.1.1 The Hermeneutical Nature of Education
Education is essentially interpretive activity. Teachers interpret and convey knowledge to suit learners, and learners interpret it in their own way. Complete transmission of knowledge is impossible in education and always goes through a process of interpretation.

Dewey's experiential education theory aligns with this interpretive perspective. Learning is reconstruction of experience, which is the process of transforming existing interpretation into new interpretation.

#### 15.1.2 Curriculum and the Politics of Interpretation
The construction of curriculum is an interpretive decision about the selection and organization of knowledge. What to teach and how to teach reflects specific values and worldviews.

Apple's sociology of curriculum shows that curriculum is not neutral but reflects the interests of specific groups. Education is also a device that reproduces dominant interpretation.

---

## Chapter 16: Future Prospects and Limitations

### 16.1 The Future of Interpretation

#### 16.1.1 Technology and Changes in Interpretation
Technological developments such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and brain-computer interfaces will change aspects of interpretation. How machine and human interpretation will interact is an unknown territory.

The development of neuroscience may more accurately reveal the neurological mechanisms of interpretation. However, this does not mean the reduction of interpretation.

#### 16.1.2 Formation of Global Interpretive Communities
Through the internet and social media, global interpretive communities are forming. Networks of interpretation that transcend regional and ethnic boundaries emerge.

However, simultaneously, polarization of interpretation and echo chamber phenomena also appear. The tendency to communicate only among people sharing the same interpretation may strengthen.

### 16.2 Limitations and Criticisms of the Proposition

#### 16.2.1 The Problem of Infinite Regress
The proposition "perception accompanies interpretation" is itself a product of interpretation. This can cause infinite regress. Interpretation of interpretation, interpretation of interpretation of interpretation...

This infinite regress may not actually be problematic. Practically, we can stop interpretation at appropriate points, and philosophically, this regress itself shows the truth of the proposition.

#### 16.2.2 The Danger of Relativism
If all perception depends on interpretation, is there no absolute truth? This can lead to cognitive relativism or moral relativism.

However, the proposition does not imply simple relativism. Dialogue, criticism, and verification between interpretations are still possible and necessary.

### 16.3 New Philosophical Tasks

#### 16.3.1 Development of Interpretive Ethics
If the inevitability of interpretation is acknowledged, the question of how to interpret becomes important. Ethics of interpretation, virtue theory of interpretation are needed.

Tolerance, humility, open-mindedness, critical thinking, etc., can become interpretive virtues.

#### 16.3.2 Refinement of Interpretive Epistemology
The traditional epistemology's concepts of justification, truth, and knowledge must be reconstructed from an interpretive perspective. Interpretive epistemology, interpretive justification theory can develop.

Coherentism, virtue epistemology, social epistemology, etc., can become resources for interpretive epistemology.

---

## Chapter 17: Economic Implications

### 17.1 Economic Decision-Making and Interpretation

#### 17.1.1 Behavioral Economics and Interpretation
The rational actor model of traditional economics has been challenged by behavioral economics. Kahneman and Tversky's prospect theory shows that economic decision-making depends on subjective interpretation, not objective calculation.

Loss aversion, anchoring effects, framing effects, etc., all show the influence of interpretation of economic situations on decision-making.

#### 17.1.2 Social Construction of Markets
New economic sociology sees markets not as naturally given but as socially constructed. Market participants' interpretation and meaning-making form markets.

Becker's social network theory and Granovetter's concept of embeddedness show that economic action is formed by social relationships and interpretation.

#### 17.1.3 Symbolic Meaning of Money
Simmel's philosophy of money shows that money is not simply a medium of exchange but a symbol representing social relationships and values. The value of money depends on social trust and interpretation.

Modern cryptocurrencies clearly show this symbolic character of money. Bitcoin's value is determined by people's interpretation and belief rather than technical characteristics.

### 17.2 Consumption and Interpretation

#### 17.2.1 Semiotic Character of Consumption
Baudrillard's theory of consumer society sees modern consumption as pursuing sign value, not use value. Consumers consume symbolic meaning, not the material utility of goods.

Brands are aggregates of such symbolic meanings. Consumers express identity through their interpretation of brands.

#### 17.2.2 Advertising and Manipulation of Interpretation
Advertising is an interpretive device that assigns specific meaning to products. Advertising does not directly stimulate consumer desire but provides specific interpretation of products.

Williamson's analysis of advertising shows how advertising makes ideological interpretation natural.

### 17.3 Labor and Interpretation

#### 17.3.1 Meaning of Labor and Interpretation
Weber's Protestant ethic thesis analyzes the influence of religious interpretation of labor on capitalist development. Labor is not simple economic activity but meaningful practice.

Modern discourse on work-life balance and pursuit of meaningful work shows changes in interpretation of labor.

#### 17.3.2 Organizational Culture and Interpretation
Organizations are systems of shared meaning and interpretation. Organizational culture provides frameworks for members to interpret organizational situations.

Schein's organizational culture theory sees culture as consisting of assumptions, values, and artifacts, which form members' interpretations.

---

## Chapter 18: Legal Philosophy Dimension

### 18.1 Hermeneutical Nature of Law

#### 18.1.1 Theories of Legal Interpretation
There are various theories of legal interpretation. Formalism emphasizes the literal meaning of legal provisions, while teleological interpretation emphasizes legislative intent or the purpose of law. However, all legal interpretation includes the interpreter's pre-understanding and value judgments.

Dworkin's theory of legal interpretation sees legal interpretation as similar to literary interpretation. Judges attempt to construct the legal system as one coherent story.

#### 18.1.2 Constitutional Interpretation and Hermeneutics
Constitutional interpretation is the most fundamental legal interpretation. Originalism emphasizes the original intent of constitutional framers, while living constitution theory sees that the constitution should be newly interpreted according to the times.

Constitutional adjudication is a arena of competition among these different interpretive methodologies. The same constitutional provision is interpreted differently according to times and composition of the judiciary.

### 18.2 Justice and Interpretation

#### 18.2.1 Theory of Justice and Interpretive Presuppositions
Rawls' theory of justice also has specific interpretive presuppositions (free and equal individuals, rational choice, etc.). The original position is a thought experiment, and principles of justice are interpretations derived from such specific settings.

Nozick's libertarianism and Sandel's communitarianism present different conceptions of justice starting from different interpretive presuppositions.

#### 18.2.2 Relationship between Law and Morality
The Hart-Fuller debate shows differences in interpretation surrounding the relationship between law and morality. Legal positivism interprets law as factual existence, while natural law theory interprets it as norms connected to morality.

Raz's exclusive legal positivism and Dworkin's integrity theory of law each present different legal concepts.

---

## Chapter 19: Future Prospects and Limitations

### 19.1 Future of Interpretation

#### 19.1.1 Technology and Changes in Interpretation
Technological developments such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and brain-computer interfaces will change aspects of interpretation. How machine and human interpretation will interact is unknown territory.

The development of neuroscience may more accurately reveal the neurological mechanisms of interpretation. However, this does not mean the reduction of interpretation.

#### 19.1.2 Formation of Global Interpretive Communities
Through the internet and social media, global interpretive communities are forming. Networks of interpretation that transcend regional and ethnic boundaries emerge.

However, simultaneously, polarization of interpretation and echo chamber phenomena also appear. The tendency to communicate only among people sharing the same interpretation may strengthen.

#### 19.1.3 Democratization and Specialization of Interpretation
Digital technology brings democratization of interpretation. Anyone can become an interpreter, and various interpretations compete. However, simultaneously, the value of professional interpretation is also reevaluated.

The spread of fake news and conspiracy theories raises questions about the quality and reliability of interpretation. The balance between freedom of interpretation and responsibility of interpretation becomes important.

### 19.2 Limitations and Criticisms of the Proposition

#### 19.2.1 Problem of Infinite Regress
The proposition "perception accompanies interpretation" is itself a product of interpretation. This can cause infinite regress. Interpretation of interpretation, interpretation of interpretation of interpretation...

This infinite regress may not actually be problematic. Practically, we can stop interpretation at appropriate points, and philosophically, this regress itself shows the truth of the proposition.

#### 19.2.2 Danger of Relativism
If all perception depends on interpretation, is there no absolute truth? This can lead to cognitive relativism or moral relativism.

However, the proposition does not imply simple relativism. Dialogue, criticism, and verification between interpretations are still possible and necessary.

#### 19.2.3 Practical Limitations
In everyday life, we cannot always keep in mind the implications of the proposition "perception accompanies interpretation." Practically, we must act without considering the problem of interpretation in many cases.

In domains such as science, technology, law, and politics, we must make decisions and act despite the uncertainty of interpretation.

### 19.3 New Philosophical Tasks

#### 19.3.1 Development of Interpretive Ethics
If the inevitability of interpretation is acknowledged, the question of how to interpret becomes important. Ethics of interpretation, virtue theory of interpretation are needed.

Tolerance, humility, open-mindedness, critical thinking, etc., can become interpretive virtues.

#### 19.3.2 Refinement of Interpretive Epistemology
The traditional epistemology's concepts of justification, truth, and knowledge must be reconstructed from an interpretive perspective. Interpretive epistemology, interpretive justification theory can develop.

Coherentism, virtue epistemology, social epistemology, etc., can become resources for interpretive epistemology.

#### 19.3.3 Exploration of Interpretive Ontology
The relationship between being and interpretation must be explored more sophisticatedly. Is there being without interpretation? Is there interpretation without being?

The hermeneutical tradition of Heidegger, Gadamer, and Ricoeur needs to be developed in modern contexts.

## Conclusion: The Philosophical Significance of Perception-Interpretation Accompaniment


### Discovery of the Absolute Proposition

"Perception accompanies interpretation"—this seemingly simple proposition has proven to be the most solid and comprehensive principle in the history of philosophy. This proposition has the following unique characteristics:

**Absolute Indeconstructibility**: All attempts to deconstruct this proposition confirm the proposition by executing the accompaniment of perception-interpretation in the very attempt itself.

**Impossibility of Counter-example Presentation**: Since the act of presenting counter-examples itself accompanies interpretation, counter-examples are impossible in principle.

**Exclusion of Hypothetical Cases**: Even hypotheses like "if this proposition were false" show the operation of the proposition the moment they are hypothesized.

**Ontological Priority**: It is more fundamental than being itself. Even attempts to deny being are possible only through perception-interpretation.

### Transformation of Philosophical Paradigms

This proposition deconstructs several dichotomies of traditional philosophy:

**Deconstruction of Subject-Object Distinction**: Knowing subject and known object are mutually interpretively constituted. Neither independent subject nor independent object exists.

**Resolution of Empiricism-Rationalism Opposition**: Both experience and rational construction are interpretive processes. Neither pure experience nor pure reason exists.

**Nullification of Realism-Idealism Debate**: Whether reality or idea, both are accessible only through interpretation. Reality before interpretation is an unspeakable domain.

**Overcoming Absolutism-Relativism Dichotomy**: There is something absolutely certain (the accompaniment of perception-interpretation), but its concrete content is relative and variable.

### Implications for Academic Disciplines

**Philosophy of Science**: Scientific observation also depends on theory, and paradigm changes are changes in interpretive frameworks. Scientific objectivity is a stabilized form of intersubjective interpretation.

**Ethics**: Moral judgments depend on interpretation of situations. Universal ethical principles also require interpretation in concrete application.

**Aesthetics**: Artistic works are completed only through appreciation. Aesthetic value emerges from the interpretive interaction between work and appreciator.

**Political Philosophy**: Political concepts (freedom, equality, justice) are objects of struggle over interpretation. Democracy is an institution that manages the diversity of interpretation.

**Education**: Education is essentially interpretive activity. The development of interpretive ability, not the transmission of knowledge, is the core of education.

### Existential Implications

At the level of individual life, this proposition has the following meanings:

**Interpretive Construction of Identity**: I become me by interpreting myself. Identity is not discovered but constructed.

**Relationship with Others**: Understanding others cannot avoid interpretive circulation. However, this circulation is not vicious but a process of deepening mutual understanding.

**Meaning of Life**: The meaning of life is not given but created through interpretation. The diversity of meaning is richness, not confusion.

**Interpretation of Death**: Even death is approached only through the interpretation of the living. Death is the absolute limit of interpretation while simultaneously being the condition that makes interpretation possible.

### Prison and Freedom of Interpretive Existence

This proposition creates a paradoxical situation. On one hand, it is an absolute "prison" from which we cannot escape interpretation. On the other hand, it provides the "freedom" of infinite interpretive possibilities.

**Ontological Prison**: We are trapped in the prison of interpretation. We cannot exit this prison, and even attempts to exit are events within the prison.

**Interpretive Freedom**: However, within this prison we have infinite freedom of interpretation. The same reality can be interpreted in countless different ways.

**Creative Constraints**: Constraints make creation possible. The inevitability of interpretation opens infinite possibilities of creative interpretation.

### Unresolved Problems and Future Tasks

New philosophical tasks raised by this proposition:

**Ethics of Interpretation**: If interpretation is inevitable, how should we interpret? The responsibility and ethics of interpretation become important.

**Politics of Interpretation**: Who has the right to interpret? The distribution and democratization of interpretive power is a key issue.

**Education of Interpretation**: How to develop interpretive ability? Education in critical interpretation, creative interpretation, and tolerant interpretation is needed.

**Technology and Interpretation**: Can artificial intelligence also interpret? How is machine interpretation different from human interpretation?

### Philosophical Humility and Courage

This proposition simultaneously requires philosophical humility and courage:

**Humility**: The humility that all our perception is merely interpretation. Abandoning claims to monopoly on absolute truth.

**Courage**: Nevertheless, the courage to interpret, judge, and act. The courage to live life despite uncertainty.

**Wisdom**: The wisdom to pursue a better life and better world through interpretation while acknowledging the limits of interpretation.

### Final Reflection

The proposition "perception accompanies interpretation" is both the end and the beginning of philosophy. It is the absolute foundation of all philosophical inquiry while simultaneously being the driving force that makes all inquiry begin anew.

This proposition reminds us of the following:

- We are interpreting beings and exist only through interpretation.
- All perception is perspective, and all perspective is one interpretation.
- The diversity of interpretation is not confusion but the richness of human spirit.
- There is no absolute certainty, but the certainty of interpretation is absolute.
- We are trapped in the prison of interpretation, but we enjoy infinite freedom within that prison.

At the end of this report, we return to the original proposition. But now that proposition approaches us not as a simple sentence, but as the most fundamental condition of being, thinking, and living.

*Perception accompanies interpretation.*

This is both the bottom of philosophy we have reached and the peak of philosophy from which we will newly begin.
