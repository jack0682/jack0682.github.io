## Chapter 1: The Language of Politics We Have Lost

Politics has always begun with words, been sustained by words, and been damaged by words. Yet these words are neither mere instruments of communication nor slogans designed to persuade the masses. Political language serves as the "blueprint of the world," constituting the fundamental and originating force that determines what human communities will point toward and what they will exclude, which forms of life they will respect and which ways of living they will constrain. Language is not a tool but the very form of the world, and political language is precisely the ontological apparatus that builds the world upon those words. Therefore, when we say that we have lost the language of politics today, this does not simply mean that eloquent politicians have disappeared, but rather that we have forfeited the linguistic foundation through which we define ourselves.

Contemporary political discourse has been reduced to the language of statistics and procedures, emotion and stimulation. Algorithms that track public opinion, marketing that packages policy, the partisan nature of discourse swaying between rage and euphoria—politics no longer asks "Who are we?" Instead, only these questions remain: "What can we provide?" "Whom shall we make victorious?" "How shall we respond more effectively?" Within this current, politics has gradually expelled questions of philosophy and ideals, responsibility and ethics, existence and freedom. Consequently, politics has become a technique, administration has become procedure, and citizens have become customers.

We have reduced politics to a matter of "management" within this prolonged era of delegation. Who executes better, who secures more budget, who can explain more data—yet politics is not a matter of management. Politics is a matter of design, and design always presupposes existence. What kind of existence are we now, and what kind of existence should we become? This question must serve as the starting point of politics. Design without management leads to chaos, but management without design remains unmemorable. What we witness now is precisely this unmemorable politics—the politics of reaction absent of design.

Politics is the act of thinking through community. It is not an administrative taxonomy but a way of constituting existence. When Plato sought the form of justice through the "Idea," when Arendt sought to open the space of politics through human action, both ultimately departed from the intuition that politics must become not merely institutions or procedures, but "the form of responsibility among living human beings." Politics is the ceaseless questioning of the way of life we have chosen to live together, and it is the space structured as the method of bearing that questioning.

Where, then, do we stand now? What words have we ceased to speak? What questions, what possibilities, what ethics do we no longer interrogate? And above all, where do we seek to go now? This writing begins with those questions. Rather than merely examining the rights and wrongs of particular parties or politicians, it seeks to ask how we might once again bear the word that is politics.

We now live within the politics of reaction. Campaign promises are adjusted according to polling results, discourse drifts within waves of anger and sentiment. "Ought" has become an object of ridicule, "ideals" have become symbols of unreality. The phrase "What's realistic?" has become an incantation that halts all thinking, and the sentence "It doesn't work in reality" has become an indulgence that discards philosophy. But I wish to ask: Since when have we made accepting reality without criticism a virtue? Since when have we abandoned philosophy in favor of efficiency, and since when have we insisted on procedure instead of thought?

Reality is important. But reality is not the goal—it is merely the starting point. Politics must serve as the compass that stands upon that reality and sets direction toward what lies beyond. Politics without ideals amounts to nothing more than short-term performative acts, and policy without philosophy drifts within the illusion of pragmatism. Politics must be able to speak not of present rightness but of tomorrow's meaning. We must speak so that existence is not merely reduced to survival, so that politics can once again be conceived in the dimension of existence.

Politics is the responsibility of citizens. It is not authority manifested only when voting, but a way of being that questions, interprets, and bears responsibility. Politics is not a field of emotion but a space of ethics. We are sovereign when we question, when we think, when we doubt through silence. This age tells those who speak of ideals that they "don't understand reality." But I believe that only those who understand reality most deeply can embrace ideals to the end, because reality is precisely the mirror that shows us in detail what we have abandoned.

Now the language of politics must be rewritten. Not in the language of emotion but in the language of philosophy, not in the language of agitation but in the language of structure, not in the language of division but in the language of responsibility. Politics must be a response to existence and must be a language capable of designing community. In this writing, I seek to compose the first sentence in recovering that language. This is both the work of reviving memory of politics and the work of opening the possibility that we are beings who can speak again.

We must become "citizens as designers" once more. Not merely subjects who vote, but subjects who can imagine common order and share responsibility. Politics is not the technique of some specialists but the form of thinking that all existence must bear. We must ask again and speak again. Why politics? Why structure? Why philosophy? And that questioning must now become not merely declaration but a journey. A journey begins not in severance but in continuity. Therefore, we ask next: What politics does the structure hidden within the life we live daily speak of?

## Chapter 2: The Rhythm of the City, the Pulse of Society: Seeing the Structure of Politics in the Structure of Daily Life

The sensation that politics feels distant is perhaps the deepest misunderstanding and the most cunning product of resignation. Politics has always been arranged as if it exists only within the solid building of the National Assembly, upon the tables of grand agendas, within the president's voice and the lighting of press conferences. But these are merely the posters of politics, not politics itself. Politics is not distant from us—it resides in the firmness of the sidewalks we tread daily, in the intervals between subway trains, in the predetermined length of lunch hours, in the flow of time as we swallow coffee beneath the light of convenience stores. We live upon political rhythms while mistaking them for the apolitical.

I walk through the city. More precisely, the city makes me walk. Walking is not an action but a movement guided, disciplined, and controlled by structure. The density of downtown reduces my stride, traffic signals reconstruct my rhythm. I appear to move of my own accord, yet I am being readjusted in my speed and destination within an already determined framework. Someone might say this is natural, but this very naturalness is the product of the most meticulous design and the most sophisticated face of politics. "Daily life" appears not to be an institution, yet it is precisely the realization of institutions. Institutions are embodied not in legal statutes but in movements that pass through people's bodies.

This rhythm of the city is control disguised as autonomy, commands arranged within silence. Companies do not give orders, yet members move with clarity. Overtime is not mandated, but the silence that remains at desks commands itself. The subway does not demand punctuality from me, but it is structured to make me move according to its schedule. CCTV does not directly instruct me, but it makes me internalize the awareness of "being watched." All of this constitutes designed flow and imperceptible coercion. Politics is always not only the distribution of power but also the distribution of life's forms. Politics comes in the name of institutions but penetrates as life's rhythm. Therefore, the most political is the most mundane.

We think ourselves free, yet that freedom is exercised only within already adjusted options. Consumption is suggested by algorithms, political thought is constrained by media frames. Choice that appears autonomous is already structurally induced decision. This is control wearing the guise of freedom. Voting is possible, but access to information about what choices we might contemplate, autonomy of thought, and space for private deliberation free from the pressure of emotion and public opinion are extremely limited. Control is no longer violent. Control is the structure of autonomization that makes us feel anxious if we do not control ourselves. It is internalized structural surveillance and guidance within the illusion that makes us believe we choose for ourselves.

The city is speaking. It speaks not through slogans but through the manner of rhythm, through the color of illumination, through the structure of arrangement. If we do not hear that speech, the city attunes our bodies through wordless commands, making it appear as if we chose to do so ourselves. But we never chose. We did not respond; we merely adapted. And that adaptation is not undesigned but a meticulously constructed political environment. The length of lunch hours, the starting time of meetings, the location of building elevators, the arrangement of school desks—these are the concrete scenes where politics actually operates.

Politics is not only legislation. It is intervention and attunement regarding the rhythm that forms life. Politics is the decision about the way communities breathe and the intangible order that distributes when, where, and how we speak, and how much we must remain silent. Politics is the politics of form that defines the mode of human existence. We must no longer repeat the phrase "Politics is what politicians do." The cities designed by politicians, the life patterns those cities demand, the structures that make us comply with those life patterns—all of this proves that we are not free from politics outside the voting booth. Voting is merely the beginning, and every day after voting is structure as political consequence.

Then we cannot help but ask: Who designed this rhythm of the city? To whose interests is this flow aligned, and upon whose fatigue is it constructed? Is this rhythm just, sustainable, and free? If we do not question this structure, the structure operates only in ways that silence us. We call it "reality," but it is reality set by someone. Unobserved structure never changes. As long as we do not question, the city will continue to issue commands to us. This is not the language of policy but the language of structure, designed reality.

Politics must return. Not to be swept into the storm of emotions but to return as philosophy that senses the structure of daily life. The city is warning us. We pursue efficiency but have lost direction, speak of freedom but defer responsibility, speak of solidarity while fearing others' gazes. All of these are political problems prior to institutions. They are questions about life's modes and requests for redesigning community's rhythm.

Politics must become philosophy again. Questions about what exists, language that imagines how those existences will live together. To speak of redesigning the city is to question the structure of society anew, and that structure must begin again from human thought. Politics is not technique or public opinion but the philosophy of sensed life. Only when we can hear again and re-attune the rhythm the city creates can we speak of "recovering politics." And that recovery begins at the moment when citizens as existence recover their senses, prior to structural change.

We are still asking: Who, then, is the citizen? Is he merely a consumer reacting to structure? Or is he an existence capable of sensing that structure anew and redesigning it? Now the question of politics moves beyond "policy" toward the inquiry of citizen ontology. And the next chapter begins with precisely that gaze upon existence.

## Chapter 3: The Illusion of Justice and the Optical Delusion of Equality: Social Regression Created by Distribution Without Responsibility

The moment we recognize that the city's rhythm silently controls us, we find ourselves standing before a single word. This word is invoked more frequently than any other yet understood less than any other—"justice." We live affirming the word justice almost reflexively. It appears as an unassailable ideal that no one opposes. Everyone claims to want justice, and politicians speak as if they possess it. Yet no one actually attempts to design justice, because while justice earns praise the moment it is spoken, it summons conflict the moment it is made concrete. To make justice concrete means classifying someone, excluding someone, and demanding greater responsibility from someone. Politics cannot be unaware of this. Therefore, whenever politics speaks of justice, it simultaneously creates new narratives that flee from certain responsibilities. Justice is the most frequently invoked word, but it is also the language that most easily erases responsibility.

In the preceding chapter, we considered politics as structural sensation permeating life's rhythm. The arrangement of the city was political sensation, and that sensation was designed structure. Now we must confront anew the word justice that repeatedly appears within that structure. Is justice truly being spoken properly now? Why is the justice that politics speaks always reduced to "distribution"? Distribution appears clear and simple. Sharing evokes equality, and equality occupies moral superiority. However, the distribution that politics speaks of is not "sharing" but "the technique of avoidance." The moment we ask who should bear what and how, in what context that sharing became possible, political language closes its mouth. Distribution is always packaged as superficial justification, while the responsibility within it is gradually covered by silence. Universal welfare is a representative case. The phrase "for everyone" appears equal. But it erases the differences of reality. It is not equal treatment but indifference to difference.

Justice was originally language that presupposed difference. As Aristotle said, justice was "giving sameness to the same, difference to the different." This proposition of justice appears simple, but it actually requires the most delicate social sensitivity. Justice is not emotion but judgment, and equality is not uniformization but discernment. However, contemporary politics fears discernment. Judgment demands debate, and debate means loss of votes. Therefore, politics always uses the phrase "for everyone." "For everyone" is safe language. But safe language is usually language that avoids responsibility and merely appeases emotions without readjusting structure. Within this language of indiscriminate equality, contribution and parasitism, effort and avoidance, responsibility and demand all become mixed together, and politics defers its judgment within that ambiguity.

The word "universal" always sounds technical. It makes it appear as if it were an administrative measure that automatically divides budget according to predetermined formulas. Yet within it, someone bears more taxes and someone endures more silence. Citizens who fulfill their responsibilities gradually lose their motivation, and people who truly need help are buried within the superficial charts of distribution. This structure cares for no one. It appears to help everyone but ultimately helps no one sincerely. The word politics uses most frequently when avoiding responsibility is justice, and the method it prefers most when abandoning thought is universality.

Justice is not technique but philosophy. It is not simply a matter of distribution but the structure of ethical judgment that enables the question of who has lived what kind of life, what they are bearing, and why more response is needed for them now. Justice is not the fairness of distribution but the legitimacy of responsibility, and it is not the elimination of difference but the capacity to bear difference and design how to organize that difference according to public standards. Politics is ultimately the act of having the courage to bear this design, and justice is the name of the social spirit capable of performing that judgment publicly.

Now we live in a society where everyone wants to become "recipients." No one speaks of their contribution, and no one seeks to speak first of their responsibility. The language of victimhood has become moral authority, and the voice of demands has preceded community standards. Everyone speaks of benefits, but no one seeks to take responsibility for the structure that made those benefits possible. Within this structure, community gradually erodes, political language becomes slogans, and citizens degenerate into beneficiaries. Community can be sustained only upon the distribution of responsibility, because community is ethical trust among people who each bear their portion.

Justice is not a tool for managing emotions. It is the common design of how to divide the weight of shared life, how to interpret each other, and how to maintain the ethics named "us." That design must not exist only within politicians' speeches, nor should it be summarized only as policy figures. It must be arranged within the city's rhythm, within life's sentences, within the sensitivity that perceives others. Justice must no longer be declaration but structure, and structure must itself be philosophical response. And that response must now begin at the place where we once again ask the essence of politics. We must speak: Why justice? Why responsibility? Why now? That questioning can no longer be postponed, because every moment we defer that responsibility, we are abandoning one community, one ethics, one human being.

## Chapter 4: Freedom and Security: The Hidden Side of the Word "Guarantee" That We Misunderstand

Contemporary society frequently speaks the word "guarantee." Guarantees of housing, income, education and healthcare, employment and survival—these words are repeated as if they were basic rights, circulating as moral demands for some and political commodities for others. Yet what we forget is this: guarantees are never self-generating. They are orders built upon someone's bearing, structures that cannot be maintained without presupposing someone's responsibility. In other words, the phrase "guaranteed life" translates into "life with delegated responsibility." And politics functions as the structural specialist that institutionalizes this delegation. The original demand for the realization of freedom is neutralized through the mechanism of "guarantee," and the pain of choice is suspended in the name of standardized stability. In this process, we are guaranteed increasingly more, yet beneath that guarantee, the qualification to decide for ourselves and to fail—in other words, the existential condition of freedom—grows dim.

Freedom and security are not originally conflicting concepts. However, there exists a clear precedence and asymmetrical order between them. Security should be the social dividend given to those who have borne freedom. When it becomes rightified and institutionalized to be provided indiscriminately to anyone, freedom degenerates into a conditional state that presupposes others' protection. At the point where justice declined into the technique of distribution, we already witnessed the ethical collapse of community once. And now we face the form of control expanded under the name of "guarantee." What threatens freedom is never violent oppression. The most sophisticated control arrives in the form of kind guarantee, and that guarantee becomes the mechanism that reconstructs citizens as subjects of compliance.

We are learning to live increasingly dependent on institutions and have become able to demand rights with increasingly less responsibility. A society obsessed with civil service examinations, an atmosphere frantically clinging to permanent employment conversion, languages that assign symbols of stability to state subsidies—all these currents vividly demonstrate that we have made "securing stability" rather than "realizing freedom" the priority value of life. But how is that stability maintained? The state demands increasingly more information to guarantee my livelihood, and institutions attempt to adjust increasingly more modes of life to enhance effectiveness. And before we know it, we come to live under the cunning contractual condition: "If you want freedom, abandon welfare. But if you want welfare, submit to order."

Guarantee appears moral but is actually structure, and freedom feels emotional but is actually philosophy. Freedom is not the state of being able to do anything but the qualification to choose something and bear it. What politics should provide is not a stable life but the conditions for designing life and the structure for recovering from failure. Welfare should be a device that assists choice, not a blueprint that standardizes existence. Welfare that lacks the declaration "My life is my own" ultimately merely makes humans into objects, regardless of what name of rights it speaks.

We now demand increasingly more guarantees but are growing increasingly distant from freedom. Human dignity is not established through protection, and stability given without freedom cannot be called ethical life. Politics should not be a system that guarantees everything but a structure that cultivates subjects of bearing, and the state should above all be the planner of responsibility that prepares "conditions for citizens to fail with dignity." Stability gained freely and freedom built upon stability are not the same words, and the moment that order is inverted, politics becomes directionless design and citizens degenerate into humans incapable of choice.

Just as guarantee without justice was not just, stability without freedom is never humane. Therefore, what politics must now question is not merely "What shall we provide?" but "What kind of human shall we aspire toward?" Is that human a being who complies to be protected, or a being who thinks in order to bear? And it is precisely before that question that we must pause again. In the next chapter, we will confront anew how this avoidance of questioning has been justified within the indulgence called reality, how that "reality absolutism" has brought about the downfall of political philosophy.

## Chapter 5: The Fallacy of Reality Absolutism: The Collapse of a System That Abandoned Ideas

"You need to know what's realistic."

Perhaps within this brief sentence is condensed the entire trajectory of the philosophy that today's politics has abandoned and the questions we have lost. The word "reality" has at some point become the most effective excuse, the most cowardly refuge, and above all, a kind of linguistic violence that silences philosophy. Ideals have become objects of ridicule, thought has been stripped of its credentials under the name of inefficiency, and politics now speaks only of execution, not direction. The question "why" disappears, and only "how" survives. But "how" without "why" is merely speed that has lost direction, and reality without ideology is merely corrupted calculation. It is a technician's report, not the result of thought. And precisely here lies the essence of the political landscape in which we find ourselves.

In contemporary society, the phrase "being realistic" operates almost like an indulgence. We invoke it to avoid judging values, to defer decisions, to evade responsibility. But whose language defines that reality? We speak of reality as "what exists," but we do not say whether it is "what is just." Institutions are merely systems currently operating; they cannot be justice itself. Yet too often we believe we must follow them because they exist. But at this point, "reality" is no longer an object of analysis but an object of worship. This is precisely the cessation of philosophy and the abandonment of thought. Furthermore, the moment we say "I didn't create this structure," we become those who have chosen not to change that structure. Silence is not neutrality. Silence is ethics. That choice ultimately becomes political consent that justifies the continuation of existing structures. The acceptance of reality is always a philosophical choice and an ethical attitude. And beyond the practical persuasiveness that reality possesses, we must ask what administration without ideology defers.

Politics that abandons philosophy degenerates into the technique of management. Governance without morality results in compliant efficiency, and practice without ideals leads to quiet totalitarianism. We now say "politics is execution," but that execution has become directionless work. The phrase "lacking in morality but good at work" means that the very way of understanding politics has become buried in techniques and figures. But politics is not a roadmap or report. Politics is direction, judgment, and human questioning. What shall we execute first, what human image shall we pursue, what shall we acknowledge as right—without the foundation of those decisions, no administration can design community. Politics is not the sum of efficiencies. It is the structure of ethics, the direction of philosophy, the technique of responsibility. And politicians must be not merely practitioners but interpreters of emotion and translators of the age. They must be able to build bridges of thought between ideals and reality and must be able to endure uncomfortable questions to the end.

True realism is realized only when those who have analyzed reality most precisely can speak the most audacious ideals. For ideals not to become fantasy, we must think endlessly, bear responsibility to the end, and ultimately dialogue with reality. And the form of that dialogue must be not silence but philosophical utterance. The phrase "That's just how reality is" is the abandonment of questioning. The phrase "It can't be helped" is an insult to humanity. Politics must become philosophy again, and politics without philosophy loses justice, compresses freedom, and decomposes responsibility. Then we cannot help but ask: Whose reality is the "reality" this system speaks of, and who chose not to change it? And have we chosen to follow that reality, or have we given up on changing it? Politics must become questioning again. And that questioning must soon lead to the ontology of politicians, to the ethics of political delegation, to the source of community design. Because the philosophy that reconstructs reality ultimately converges on the ethics of the humans who will perform that reconstruction.

## Chapter 6: The Ontology of Politicians: What Does It Mean to Be Representatives of the People?

Whose face should politicians wear? This ancient question has been evaded for just as long. We call politicians representatives—those who convey the people's will, those who gather anger, those who refine and speak public opinion. Yet within these definitions lies a certain optical illusion. Is politics merely a reflection chamber of emotions? A microphone that voices the people's feelings in their stead? A real-time administrative automaton that follows the pulse of public sentiment? The moment we understand politicians in this way, politics becomes service rather than design, transmission rather than judgment. And at that moment, politicians are reduced not to philosophers but to relay agents, not to designers but to incomprehensible reaction machines.

Politics is the field of thought about how a community will design itself. Politics is not the technique of expressing anger but the power to structurally interpret that anger and ethically reorganize it. At this point, the essence of politicians approaches not "representatives" but "designers." They must be not those who simply reflect desires but conceptual interpreters who structure and give meaning to desires. Within a community where countless emotions and interests are entangled, politicians must judge what order is sustainable and just. They must be able to sense the tension between "what the people want" and "what the people need," and sometimes must possess the courage and insight to say "no." This is precisely the beginning of the ethics that politics must bear.

However, the political landscape we see now approaches the exact opposite. Politicians become influencers, collect responses from social media, track public opinion in real time, and adjust their language according to the highs and lows of retweet counts and view numbers. Policy becomes a tool of factionalism, elections become battlegrounds of fandoms, and politicians become real-time reactive performers. They do not walk ahead. They defer decisions, simply relay demands, and merely reflect emotions. This is politics' self-abandonment. And this self-abandonment erodes citizens' trust and reduces politics to an object of emotional fatigue and cynicism.

Politicians must be philosophers. While not ignoring emotions, they must possess the technique of translating those emotions into institutions and order. They must speak with ethics and derive the legitimacy of policy not from emotion but from philosophy. Above all, they must be controllers of their own desires. When they can refine all temptations—power and fame, approval ratings and wealth—into ideals, only then can they bear the name of politics. The design of politics gains meaning only upon such leadership. Not simple practical ability, but internal standards that can restrain practice. Without those standards, no policy can have direction. Politics that loses direction ultimately transforms into the technique of most efficiently destroying.

Yet since when have we come to regard "execution ability" as the entirety of politics? Since when have we said that morality is fine as long as there are results, that policy is right as long as administration is good? This is a philosophical error that fails to distinguish between politics and administration. Politics is the structure that asks "what shall we execute," and administration is the realization technique after that choice. No matter how excellent administrative technique may be, the direction of community becomes completely opposite depending on what philosophy it is based upon. Therefore, technique without morality becomes a weapon capable of dismantling community most quickly and precisely. Because technique is always neutral. The problem lies in the absence of judgment about where and how to use that technique.

Today's technocratic politics increasingly makes politics appear to be something other than politics. Values are regarded as sentiment, and ideals are treated as luxury. What cannot be explained in figures is not even discussed. But society is not maintained by technique. Society is maintained by narrative. Citizens want to understand. Why this policy is necessary, whom this structure is for, what this change aims toward—administration that cannot answer all these questions is not politics. Within politics replaced by technique, citizens become not subjects but objects. They become not judging beings but accessories to compliant structures. This is precisely a cold example of how administration without philosophy neutralizes community.

The greater problem is the fact that increasingly more citizens are consenting to such a system. "At least there are results," "We must distinguish between public and private," "Now is the time for pragmatism over ideals." These words are not merely individual cynicism. They are evidence that the entire community is gradually turning away from ideals and morality, thought and responsibility. Thus we begin to treat leaders' morality as a private matter and reduce citizens' political participation to numbers. Politics becomes quiet, and community quietly loses direction.

Politics is not technique. Politics is the ability to restrain technique. Public nature is established not on competence but only upon self-limitation. We must now ask not "What can they do?" but "What can they refrain from doing?" Because politics is the act of designing not how far to execute but where to stop. Without that restraint, we move quickly but arrive nowhere. Just as a building without foundation must collapse, administration without philosophy must collapse community. And what gets buried first beneath that debris is precisely citizens' dignity.

Now the question transcends politicians. If politics is sustainable only within the structure called philosophy, to whom should the completion of that philosophy be entrusted? If politicians are designers, who is the final coordinator of that design? And what qualifications can bear that coordination? We ultimately return that question to citizens. The end of politics is citizen ontology. Politics is the question of what kind of human to create, and before that question we return again to the first chapter of philosophy.

We now stand before a turning point in politics. Community is being dismantled, and the state is technically reorganizing life's conditions under the pretext of efficiency. Now citizens no longer wish to remain simple voters, and politics can no longer exist as a technical operating system composed only of pledges and administration. What is most needed at this point is the work of philosophically redesigning "the structure of politics." And deep thought about how human dignity and participation should be arranged within that structure. Unfortunately, however, those who now stand at the center of politics are still trapped in the language of the past—distribution, ethics, efficiency. Their reforms are technical, their ideals are system-friendly, and their political philosophy is silent or absent. Therefore, this chapter is constructed concisely around one question: "What structural future are the politicians of this era actually speaking of?"

Thus these candidates advance different signifiers of distribution, ethics, and efficiency. Yet what is commonly absent is philosophical design of political structure—in other words, responses to "Why must it be this structure?" "What kind of human does this structure presuppose?" "How does that human participate and take responsibility?" As a result, all their politics lean toward technique. Distribution still depends on elite administrative systems, ethics remains at moral symbolism, and reform is refined into the form of administrative planning. But politics is not merely policy coordination or functional efficiency but the design of how community will live itself. It must be philosophy, it must be thought, and questions about humanity must be presupposed.

Then the question now moves beyond politicians. What kind of politician we will elect is a reverse question about what kind of citizens we will live as. Politics is not completed by politicians alone. Politics is philosophical structure and a field of ethical coexistence, and the true operation of that structure must be connected to citizens' subjective sensitivity. The final question of politics is directed toward citizens. Now is the time to ask not what politics is but who are the citizens that make that politics possible.

And that question finally opens the next chapter.

## Chapter 7: Toward a New Structure: The Ontology of "Citizens" as Political Subjects

Politics is structure. And structure is always based on existence. Therefore, politics is no different from the question "What can existing beings bear?" Institutions do not grow by themselves. Institutions operate only when the human form capable of sustaining them is presupposed, and where that presupposition is absent, structure too is torn apart like paper. Therefore, the ultimate foundation of the politics we now seek to design is not norms, figures, or ideals, but "existence." In other words, everything begins with the question of whether the existence called citizen is realizable upon this structure.

The citizen we have spoken of thus far is no longer a participant on election day or a consumer of anger. He is not a sample of desires but a subject of thought. He is not one who claims rights within community but a political human capable of interpreting and designing community itself. This citizen is not a beneficiary of law but a reconstructor of law, not an object protected by institutions but a planner who conditions institutions. In other words, citizens must establish themselves as a "political form," and without that establishment, no politics is realized.

Whenever politics breaks down, we repair institutions. However, as long as the consciousness and sensitivity of those who operate those institutions do not change, all reforms return to regression of the past. Indeed, we have experienced multiple constitutional amendments and witnessed countless institutional modifications, yet what we ultimately faced was always the repetition of similar patterns of powerlessness, indifference, and blame-shifting. This was a failure not of institutions but of existence. Politics is a matter of "qualification" before being a matter of "form," and that qualification can only be possessed by humans who have approved themselves as subjects.

Who, then, is the citizen? The citizen is one who can doubt his own emotions. He is not merely a being who rages and demands but a being who questions whether his anger is justified and thinks about what meaning his demands can have within community. Citizens must be able to make public judgments and must know how to guard against the fact that those judgments can be biased. They not only exercise rights through participation but prove themselves through responsibility. Ultimately, politics is the form through which such citizens organize themselves and the ethical grammar through which they conceive community.

Institutions must be constructed based on this grammar. In other words, the first sentence of political reform must be the ontological redefinition of citizens. And only upon that foundation does institutional design finally gain meaning. For example, citizen-nominated proportional representation is a device that opens the closed structure of political parties under citizens' judgment. This is not merely a technical change in electoral methods but a structural declaration that citizens become the outposts of politics. The legitimacy of political parties must be secured not from their internal ideology but from external justification through citizens' delegation and oversight, and this structure reconstructs the act of politics as horizontal design rather than vertical transmission.

Furthermore, public discourse-based ministerial selection is a device that avoids concentration of power and converts citizens' ethical sensitivity into the ethics of governance. Ministers must be constituted not through presidential trust but through citizens' public judgment, and the process of that public discourse must be conducted in the language of philosophical restraint rather than emotional pros and cons. Such institutions signify not merely administrative transparency but transition to a structure that supplies political legitimacy from citizens' thought.

These institutions are not techniques of structure but practices of philosophy. Deliberative democracy differs from opinion polling. It is a mechanism of thought designed to allow citizens to mature their judgments, and delegative politics presupposes the capacity to accept philosophy beyond votes. What citizens "can bear" rather than what citizens "feel" should be the standard of political delegation. Delegation is not the sharing of emotions but the succession of responsibility, and that responsibility can only be structured in ethical form.

Furthermore, creation-centered capitalism redefines humans not merely as consumers or workers but as beings who plan possibilities. The state must no longer be a manager of survival or distributor of benefits but a space that supports human creativity and planning capacity as infrastructure, and the state at this point is not a "possessor of authority" but an "organizer of opportunities." This transformation is not merely an adjustment of economic policy but a total redesign of the view of humanity, and that redesign again calls upon the ontology of politics.

Ultimately, all political structures reflect forms of existence. Structures that existence cannot bear must fail, and only structures that existence can sustain are sustainable. We now stand before the question of what politics the existence called citizen can sustain. If citizens are consumers, politics becomes marketing; if citizens are passive beneficiaries, politics becomes the vending machine of a welfare state. However, if citizens are subjects of their own thought, politics can evolve into the design of philosophical community.

Politics is ultimately thought that asks what kind of existence humans are, and all forms of politics change according to how we perceive ourselves. Therefore, the true core of political reform is not institutional technique but ontological self-recognition. We must now question ourselves anew. Am I merely one who votes? Will I remain one who demands? Or am I one who bears responsibility?

Now politics must return to philosophy. And that philosophy ultimately begins from the question one human throws to oneself: "Am I a being capable of bearing community?" Only where this question is thrown anew can the structure of politics be completed as living, breathing ethics. At that moment, we become citizens as designers again, and politics becomes the most profound technique through which humans organize themselves.

# Chapter 8: Conclusion: What Is Politics? A System Where Morality, Structure, and Philosophy Become One

What is politics? This question is now no longer sufficient as a conceptual explanation. It is neither a simple definition of systems nor a function of institutions. Politics is ultimately a response to humanity, and it is the most fundamental form of ethics that asks under what standards that response is designed. Politics is language before institutions, judgment before law, responsibility before management. It is the way existence bears existence and a system of thought that reveals what world we seek to construct together.

We have reduced politics to the realm of technique for too long. The sophistication of policy, the efficiency of execution, the integrity of administration—these are certainly parts of politics and may be necessary conditions, but they were never sufficient conditions. Because politics is not merely asking what to do "well" but is a space of values that asks what we "should" do. Efficiency does not guarantee direction, and administration cannot substitute for the question of existence. Politics is ultimately the act that constantly calls forth essential questions: "For whom is this?" "Why now?" "What human image does this presuppose?"

Therefore, politics must begin with morality. No, politics itself must be morality. Human beings are essentially imperfect, and community is sustainable only when we can bear and take responsibility for each other's imperfections. Since leaders are those who design the structure of that community, they must be not merely competent technicians but ethical beings who know how to restrain their own desires. One who can decide "what not to do" rather than "what can be done," one who possesses the boundary lines of judgment—such is the person who can bear the qualifications of a politician.

Morality precedes law. Because while law can be interpreted, morality must be borne. Politicians must not only interpret community norms but be able to ethically explain why those norms are necessary. When that explanation is absent, politics performs violence without violence under the name of efficiency. At that point, politics is no longer design but management, not coexistence but control. Politics without morality degenerates into technique, and citizens become objects of management. And at that moment, politics loses its original name.

However, morality alone is not sufficient. Because humans are beings within structure before being individuals. No matter how moral an individual may be, they can become executors of injustice within distorted structures. Therefore, politics must be the work of converting morality into structure. Forms through which individual responsibility can be organized into collective order, multiple institutions that can absorb each other's mistakes and distribute responsibility—this is the structure of politics. Public discourse-based personnel systems, citizen participation delegation systems, citizen-nominated proportional representation—all these institutions are not merely systems but conditions through which morality can become sustainable.

Politics is ultimately philosophy. Because politics is the only institution that asks about direction. If politics disappears, society can still function, but that functioning becomes directionless. Politics without philosophy becomes a weather vane of public opinion, and political parties are reduced to marketing organizations. At that point, politics becomes a field of competition asking not "For whom is this?" but merely "Who sells better?" However, philosophy restores politics as "the thought of existence." Philosophy is slow, but that slowness is the propulsive force that goes farthest. It dismantles reality and designs dignity for the next generation through time.

Then we ask again: What is politics? It is not merely a matter of who will hold power. It is an ethical order designed so that free individuals can live together within responsible structures under philosophical leadership. In other words, politics is responsibility toward humanity. When that responsibility is performed without morality, it becomes domination; when executed without structure, it becomes accident; when operated without philosophy, it becomes technique. But when morality, structure, and philosophy meet as one, politics is finally completed as a form of existence.

Politics is not management. It is direction. Politics is the declaration of thought that humans themselves can decide how to live this world. Do we still possess the possibility of that politics? Are we indeed citizens capable of bearing the responsibility of that politics? Politics is not voting but a way of being. It is the most everyday technique of thought that designs the rhythm of our lives within daily language, within every moment's judgment.

Now we must no longer use the word "people" as "objects of management." The people must be citizens—those who can design themselves. Politics must be the designed respect of people living together, and when that respect leads to law, to structure, to thought, only then does politics become philosophy. And at the moment philosophy embraces politics, we become not merely members of a state but subjects who bear existence as humans themselves.

What is politics? It is the deepest response to what kind of existence we wish to become. And we must now write that response in our own names.
