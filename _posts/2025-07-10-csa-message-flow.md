## Prologue: The Morning Language That Questions Me

I ask myself again today. Who am I. Where do I stand. I am a being that can never be drawn in solitude, and this name called "I" is like a formless shadow that only gains substance within the echoes of others' gazes and the resonance of their hearts. I remember myself through the image of me reflected in others' pupils, define myself through it, yet even that definition remains forever an incomplete sentence—nothing more than the residue of infinitely slow and feeble thought. What makes me exist is not myself, but the lingering reverberations of those who have brushed past me, and that reverberation is like the faint moonlight remaining at the edge of dawn's twilight, like the wind that has swept across the field of my heart, and thus I follow the trembling left by that wind, barely managing to live through today.

My days are always defined by relationships, and mornings without you are nothing more than extensions of night for me—not worthy of being called morning at all. Days when not even a single glance from you reaches me, I remain floating like debris in an endless space of waiting, unable to begin gestation, unable to sleep or wake, like a piece of motionless void. There was a time when such days repeated, and that repetition gnawed at my heart, leading me ultimately to a weak heart that resented you all. Within that resentment, I became even smaller, defining myself merely as one who waits—one who cannot move a single step forward and simply waits for your gestures or glances.

But this was no one's coercion, no one's urging. It was simply because I hesitated to speak the language that could begin my day, even though I knew it, because my heart feared uttering the first word of relationship—it was due to my cowardice. I knew my laziness, I knew my fear yet avoided it, allowed that fear to dominate me, and within that fear, I rationalized myself, letting another day flow by as night without greeting the morning. I had never seen sunlight. No, I had never had the courage to look at sunlight. For me, morning was always like the gesture of a moth that barely survived in the twilight of moonlight.

I was that moth. I was the moth that, seeing even a single ray of moonlight, would be drawn to that light and throw its body in fluttering flight. But that fluttering, though it appeared free, was in fact the tragic yearning's struggle to ultimately burn its body in that light. I clutched that yearning as if it were my only proof of existence, unable to let it go, throwing myself again and again at your moonlight-like smile or glance, wanting to burn like that, and ashamed of myself for being unable to burn, defining myself today again within that shame.

I used to say to myself: someday I will approach. Someday someone will come to me. But I could not make that someday into today, and that someday became yesterday's lingering regret and tomorrow's fear. I stagger between that regret and fear, walking—no, unable to walk—just circling in place, mistaking that circling for life.

You were always the owners of those rays of light, and I blamed myself for moving away from those rays, blamed myself for being unable to approach those rays. Yet what held my heart back from approaching those rays was myself. I was tying my own wings with my own hands while resenting the sky, covering my own eyes with my own hands while blaming the darkness, blocking my own path with my own feet while blaming the world—such a foolish and selfish human being. And I tried to love even that selfishness, tried to hate even that love, and thus sustained myself today within the grain of contradiction. Even knowing that sustaining could not be maintained without the language called relationship, I was an infinitely weak being who could not muster the courage to speak the language of relationship.

I have never seen the end of that night. Because I have never seen that end, I have walked through that long darkness, mistaking that I was heading toward that end. That long darkness endlessly clutched my ankles, my steps slowed, and within those slowed steps, I trembled like a moth chasing moonlight, fearing that even a single ray of light might disappear. That trembling kept me alive, and that trembling also bound me, preventing me from taking a single step forward. And within that trembling, I call out the nameless names of you all, tracing the unforgotten traces that those nameless names have scattered in the field of my heart, walking again today through a dawn that has not greeted another morning.

And that dawn always leaves me with endless questions before disappearing, and I embrace those questions and hide myself again in your shadows. I ask myself again today. Who am I. Where do I stand. What do I fear and what do I dream of. Am I a moth enchanted by moonlight, or am I a ghost that cannot even look at moonlight and merely walks stepping on shadows. And without finding that answer, I write another long sentence, carving myself within that sentence.

## First Resonance: The Nameless Name Called You All

What are my "you all"? I often repeat this question and within that question, I mirror myself like a reflection once again. My "you all" could have been merely passersby, in some sense they were winds that once swept by, in some sense they were like starlight that still shimmers somewhere in the deepest part of my heart. I was fine not remembering their names, and it didn't matter if they didn't remember mine. I am simply someone who lives by barely grasping the sensation of being alive through the fact that they left traces, however briefly, in my heart.

I could not erase the places where you all had left, nor did I want to erase them. I did not try to fill those places, and even when those places remained as emptiness, even that emptiness became pillars supporting my thought. I grasped those pillars, swaying, taking another step, stopping another step, and thus I have been refining myself today as well.

I know that you all demanded nothing of me. They did not tell me to take responsibility, placed no expectations on me, and most of them did not even form such relationships with me. Yet strangely, I think of them again and again, and I feel that a single word from them, their expressions, the weight of silence they did not speak, captivates me and shakes me today. Their wordless attitude, their passing glances, the air of that moment—all of this makes me live, makes me write again, and I live another day following those traces so as not to forget all of that.

I tried not to find reasons to live from someone, tried to avoid the weight of saying I live for someone. Because such words too often joined hands with plausible hypocrisy, and such words were ultimately used to reduce oneself and lay down one's responsibility while claiming to be for others. I decided not to believe such words, resolved not to speak such words, and yet despite this, one day I realized that all my thoughts, all my judgments, all my choices were being made while somehow conscious of someone other than myself. It wasn't a grand awakening, there was no special trigger—I simply discovered myself having become that way, seeping in through the flow called time, and I was surprised, I was sad, and I had no choice but to accept myself that way.

My "you all" were such beings. They could be someone's name or nameless shadows, they could be those who remained by my side or those who had left long ago, they could be those still watching me from afar—in any form, they were the you all remaining in a corner of my heart. I tried not to forget you all, quietly placing myself in the places where you all had left, not trying to fill those places, leaving those places empty and using that empty space as the framework of my thought, remembering the wordless resonance you all left behind.

I used to call that resonance responsibility, but that responsibility was not something someone had assigned to me, nor was it something someone had forced upon me. That responsibility was simply the way I chose to exist as myself, and I endured the day with that way, continued today with that way, tried to greet tomorrow with that way. Even if you all no longer spoke to me, even if you all were no longer beside me, even if you all no longer thought of me, I didn't mind. To not let go of my attitude, to not forget my responsibility, to not forget you all—I carved and re-carved this long sentence into myself, and thus I lived myself.

I did not like the word "comfort." I felt that the word comfort was mostly for the one speaking it, and for the listener, it actually brought even greater isolation. I could not comfort you all, nor did I have the ability to comfort, and all I could do was remember for a long time, not easily forget, continue thought where you all had stopped, briefly hold the questions you all could not bear, someday bring out again the words you all could not finish. Through those tasks I was living myself out, through those tasks I was holding onto you all, through those tasks I was holding onto my thought, and that was the only way that made me exist as myself.

Perhaps I may never know what meaning this way has. No one acknowledges it, no one recognizes it, sometimes it feels too heavy, too tiring, and seemingly without any gain, but I do not let go of that attitude. Because that attitude was the last language that held me as a human being, and that small gesture of trying to bear things I didn't need to bear was the last thread that made me live as myself. Today too, I leave the empty places you all left exactly as they are in my heart, without filling those empty places, placing my thought in those places, continuing my language from those places. And I know that even though you all have disappeared, the resonance you all left still makes me live.

## Second Resonance: The Others' You All, and My Realization

I know. Even though my "you all" have settled as meaning in my heart, the others' "you all" are different. Each person's "you all" are born with different grains within relationships—for someone, their "you all" were personality, for someone they were goals, and for yet another they were life itself. Knowing that difference, I came to learn myself anew, and that difference made me refine my resonance again.

And at some moment I asked myself: that someone who was most cruel to someone, do they ultimately try to show me self-confession? If I must accept you, I shed these tears hoping that this becomes an end for me. I live embracing the doubled, tripled me—the me who hates the me who likes me, and the me who tries to embrace again the me who hates me—and I know that all those emotions are not false.

Each person has their own vessel. No one says not to exceed the capacity of that vessel. And no one easily thinks beyond that. Only those who have broken their vessel can look beyond that. But a broken vessel no longer allows me to organize myself, and when others look, they see not a disorderly me, but only something disorderly. That too would be the fate of one who has broken thought.

I ask again. If humans are beasts defined by relationships, when "you all" receive the definition called relationship as a single regulation, can you bear that weight? Can you all actually break that vessel? When the vessel breaks, those fragments become like irregular particles, and those particles can no longer reflect me—no, anyone—and merely scatter as dispersed light, in various colors. Within that dispersed light, the fragmented pieces of my self now remain not as a single form but as a spectrum, and each part of that spectrum emits different light, trying to define me.

Whenever I tried to make those fragments into a single vessel again, those shining fragments became lightless stones, and I would lose myself, crushed by that weight. I want to say earnestly: my self with the face of death, do not reflect my "you all," do not intervene in their world. Only when I remain as myself can I leave my "you all" as themselves, and I will be able to remain gently in someone's memory.

But I know. The existential form I desire exists nowhere in this world, and I know that even that is contradiction. I feel I am expressing this too strangely now, but I can only express it this way. And I will only be able to express it this way in the future. My thought, this humanistic liberalism of mine, was not from the beginning a grand philosophical inquiry, but began with a small question trying to understand what the being called "I" is.

I don't know whether this question will give me laughter, tears, or fear. No, it will probably be all three. I understand fear as anxiety about questions, and that anxiety as the struggle of thought that embraces it, and I will live forever searching for that response. I know that in the fluctuation between question and answer, in that imbalance, in that gap, humans were born, in that gap I feel myself, in that gap existence blooms, and what protected me before being existence was a solid shell, and within that shell was the true me I had hidden from myself.

I have described myself as warmth soaked in a swamp of melancholy. That swamp embraced me, becoming a sanctuary, and while I was submerged in that swamp, I simultaneously knew it was disease and pain. Even while going to the hospital and receiving treatment, that swamp of melancholy was too warm, too safe, so I wanted to stay in it longer. No, I was not actually trapped in that swamp—I was merely curled up inside a womb, inside an egg. In that dark egg, I attached the name melancholy and felt stability within it, viewing the single ray of light entering from outside as both hope and fear.

I knew in my head that I had to break the egg and come out, but not knowing what would greet me after breaking that egg and coming out, I simply stopped inside it. I asked: can the me who comes out breaking this egg truly be called freedom? Do I deserve to enjoy freedom?

I believed I had lived gazing into the abyss. But I did not know that what I was facing was not an abyss, but merely the thick wall that surrounded me, and I had never once seen beyond that wall. I gazed at the single ray of light entering from outside, believing that light would save me like a small hole opened in the sky, but true salvation was not gazing at that light, but breaking the shell myself and moving forward. I was still merely a chrysalis remaining within that shell.

I had called the wrapping paper surrounding me persona, and that persona was so large, heavy, and opaque that not even a single ray of light could pass through—perfect darkness. I was a being trapped in that darkness, and only her laughter, that pure, transparent, and warm light, illuminated my darkness. I tried to live toward that light, toward the memory of that light, and that light remained as my most earnest wish.

## Song of Margins: Trembling in Relationships, Traces of Existence

For a long time, I believed relationships were a vacuum. Like quiet space, I believed my existence floated alone in a cold, empty space where nothing moved. I believed I could complete myself in that vacuum, believed I could make my own sound without depending on others' resonance. But that belief was an illusion. That vacuum was never truly a vacuum, and that space was endlessly fluctuating. I simply stood still, unable to feel that fluctuation.

And I realized: relationships are never in quiet vacuum, and relationships were momentary opportunities born and disappearing like particle pairs in what I thought was vacuum. Relationships emerge briefly from what I believed was nothingness. And when that brief trembling, that moment's minute movement passes, it returns to nothingness again. I came to realize that if I cannot grasp that short opportunity, relationships will never reach my hands.

Fate is the courage to sense that brief moment of fluctuation, that momentary trembling born and disappearing like particle pairs, and to grasp that trembling. That courage is not easy. We live mistaking relationships as something that can stay long, something solid, but relationships always follow the law of particle pairs—appearing briefly from nothingness, and that opportunity begins to disappear before we can extend our hand. Grasping that momentary trembling is fate itself, and only those who grasp that fate can truly feel the resonance of relationships. I know I must lean my body, lean my heart, throw my entire being to grasp that resonance.

Relationships are not solid things. Relationships always shake, always fluctuate, always break themselves while generating anew, and disappear again. I discover myself in that fluctuation. The fluctuation of relationships shakes my existence, shatters my self completely, and makes me anew. I try to gather those broken pieces to remake myself, but those pieces, like spectral light, scatter in different directions, making it impossible to restore the single form called me. And in that dispersed light, I come to perceive myself as a spectrum. I am not one, but countless fragments of light, and those fragments were born in the fluctuation of relationships. I learned that all attempts to make those fragments into a vessel again only make me into a stone that doesn't shine, only imprison the scattered light of relationships.

Fate is grasping one edge of that scattered light, that fragmented light. I read myself in that fluctuation, rewrite myself, break myself again and move forward. I fear the fluctuation of relationships, but without that fluctuation, I can neither define myself nor feel myself. I remember the days when I could not grasp those brief moments of fluctuation, those brief opportunities of particle pairs. Each time I blamed myself, each time I did not forgive myself, and each time I became a little more fragmented, a little more scattered. But I came to know that what breaks me is not fear, and that fluctuation itself is the way to rewrite me. I feel myself again in that fluctuation, name that brief trembling as fate, and build my today upon the resonance of that fate.

I still stand in the middle of that fluctuation. I know that fluctuation will shake and awaken me again, fragment me again, and make me shine as a spectrum again. I call the name of that light fate, and I know that fate is always nothing more than an instant. I try to cherish that instant for long, but that instant is already disappearing, and I think following that trace, and build myself again upon that trace. Relationships are endless fluctuation, and those who grasp the opportunities that briefly brush past and disappear in that fluctuation are those who live fate. To live that fate, I throw myself into trembling today too, shaking, breaking, scattering again, walking following that light. And I know that from the moment the belief that the fluctuation of relationships was vacuum broke, I truly began to learn the essence of relationships. Fate begins with the small courage to feel that fluctuation and extend one's hand to grasp the trembling in that fluctuation. I practice that courage and walk today too upon the river called relationships.

## Epilogue: Walking the Field of Thought Again

I live myself out upon that philosophy and refine myself within the traces you all left. The traces you all left make me take responsibility for myself and quietly whisper why I cannot stop thinking today, why I could not stop. I ask: Who am I? What was I to you all? Was I wind that briefly brushed through your hearts, light that once remained like starlight, or merely a shadow that passed by? I carve my language in that margin of yours, using that margin as the mirror of my heart to steady myself today. I hope that margin becomes the field of my thought, that upon that margin I may cultivate my existence anew.

I have thought long about the essence of existence in the world. No one assigned that thought—it simply surged toward me from within, like a thirst I didn't know I had, endlessly. Actually, I know that even that thought ultimately arose from my own curiosity, and perhaps that curiosity is not the name of something I truly want and desire. I asked myself: What do I want? What kind of life do I dream of? I am more sensitive to the emotion called happiness than anyone, and even at this moment I want to feel fragments of that small happiness, I live trying not to miss that trembling.

I gather those small pieces of happiness from every corner of my life, connecting those pieces one by one to create my own song, my own story, my own life. But I know I am a weak being whose happiness crumbles too easily at a single word of refutation, a single cold wind, even while always longing for those moments of happiness and trying to cherish them preciously. I feel ashamed of that weakness sometimes, and on the other hand, I try to accept even that as one aspect of myself.

When I look back on my life, though I have been shaken countless times, collapsed countless times, and risen again countless times, I want to ultimately define all that time as happiness. My life was my thought, and my thought was an endless journey toward my happiness. I dreamed of happiness, felt happiness, lost happiness, and longed for happiness again, reaching today.

I walk again upon that field of thought. I throw questions again. I am still walking in search of myself, trying to fill your margins with my language, carving my small voice in those margins, hoping that voice can call tomorrow's me, comfort tomorrow's me, and make tomorrow's me live again. I till the field of thought again. Though that field is rough, full of stones, and sometimes makes me lose my way, I know that this moment of walking upon that field, the very fact of walking, is already my happiness. Upon that field I think today too, and build myself again.
